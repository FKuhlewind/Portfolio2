      <p>This is my second and last portfolio for the course <a href="http://ast.codingthehumanities.com/" target="_blank">Art, Science and Technology</a>, taken as part of my masters degree in General Linguistics at the University of Amsterdam. In this work I present the skills I have acquired during the course of the seminar while reflecting on how they could be beneficial to the humanities.</p> 
      <p>In my <a href="http://fkuhlewind.github.io/Portofolio1/#home" target="_blank">first portfolio</a> I have put a focus on the technological side of coding and being overwhelmed by some of its possibilities, I tried to put as many aspects into practice as was possible for me at the time. With the present portfolio I try to focus on how those technological skills can be put into practice in such a way that scholars in the humanities can benefit from them. With the sources available, I put a focus on applications that relate to the field of linguistics.</p>
      <p>My aim was also to try a new approach towards design and usability. The website should be simple, appealing and easy to navigate. Its <a href="https://github.com/FKuhlewind/Portfolio2/tree/gh-pages/elements" target="_blank">components</a> aim to be self-explanatory and the overall design should support the content.</p>
      <p>I hope that my plan succeeded and that you enjoy scrolling the rainbow!</p>
