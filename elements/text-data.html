  "text": "\"All models are wrong, but some are useful.\"\nSo proclaimed statistician George Box 30 years ago, and he was right. But what choice did we have? Only models, from cosmological equations to theories of human behavior, seemed to be able to consistently, if imperfectly, explain the world around us. Until now. Today companies like Google, which have grown up in an era of massively abundant data, don't have to settle for wrong models. Indeed, they don't have to settle for models at all.\nSixty years ago, digital computers made information readable. Twenty years ago, the Internet made it reachable. Ten years ago, the first search engine crawlers made it a single database. Now Google and like-minded companies are sifting through the most measured age in history, treating this massive corpus as a laboratory of the human condition. They are the children of the Petabyte Age.\nThe Petabyte Age is different because more is different. Kilobytes were stored on floppy disks. Megabytes were stored on hard disks. Terabytes were stored in disk arrays. Petabytes are stored in the cloud. As we moved along that progression, we went from the folder analogy to the file cabinet analogy to the library analogy to — well, at petabytes we ran out of organizational analogies.\nAt the petabyte scale, information is not a matter of simple three- and four-dimensional taxonomy and order but of dimensionally agnostic statistics. It calls for an entirely different approach, one that requires us to lose the tether of data as something that can be visualized in its totality. It forces us to view data mathematically first and establish a context for it later. For instance, Google conquered the advertising world with nothing more than applied mathematics. It didn't pretend to know anything about the culture and conventions of advertising — it just assumed that better data, with better analytical tools, would win the day. And Google was right.\nGoogle's founding philosophy is that we don't know why this page is better than that one: If the statistics of incoming links say it is, that's good enough. No semantic or causal analysis is required. That's why Google can translate languages without actually \"knowing\" them (given equal corpus data, Google can translate Klingon into Farsi as easily as it can translate French into German). And why it can match ads to content without any knowledge or assumptions about the ads or the content.\nSpeaking at the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference this past March, Peter Norvig, Google's research director, offered an update to George Box's maxim: \"All models are wrong, and increasingly you can succeed without them.\"\nThis is a world where massive amounts of data and applied mathematics replace every other tool that might be brought to bear. Out with every theory of human behavior, from linguistics to sociology. Forget taxonomy, ontology, and psychology. Who knows why people do what they do? The point is they do it, and we can track and measure it with unprecedented fidelity. With enough data, the numbers speak for themselves.\nThe big target here isn't advertising, though. It's science. The scientific method is built around testable hypotheses. These models, for the most part, are systems visualized in the minds of scientists. The models are then tested, and experiments confirm or falsify theoretical models of how the world works. This is the way science has worked for hundreds of years.\nScientists are trained to recognize that correlation is not causation, that no conclusions should be drawn simply on the basis of correlation between X and Y (it could just be a coincidence). Instead, you must understand the underlying mechanisms that connect the two. Once you have a model, you can connect the data sets with confidence. Data without a model is just noise.\nBut faced with massive data, this approach to science — hypothesize, model, test — is becoming obsolete. Consider physics: Newtonian models were crude approximations of the truth (wrong at the atomic level, but still useful). A hundred years ago, statistically based quantum mechanics offered a better picture — but quantum mechanics is yet another model, and as such it, too, is flawed, no doubt a caricature of a more complex underlying reality. The reason physics has drifted into theoretical speculation about n-dimensional grand unified models over the past few decades (the \"beautiful story\" phase of a discipline starved of data) is that we don't know how to run the experiments that would falsify the hypotheses — the energies are too high, the accelerators too expensive, and so on.\nNow biology is heading in the same direction. The models we were taught in school about \"dominant\" and \"recessive\" genes steering a strictly Mendelian process have turned out to be an even greater simplification of reality than Newton's laws. The discovery of gene-protein interactions and other aspects of epigenetics has challenged the view of DNA as destiny and even introduced evidence that environment can influence inheritable traits, something once considered a genetic impossibility.\nIn short, the more we learn about biology, the further we find ourselves from a model that can explain it.\nThere is now a better way. Petabytes allow us to say: \"Correlation is enough.\" We can stop looking for models. We can analyze the data without hypotheses about what it might show. We can throw the numbers into the biggest computing clusters the world has ever seen and let statistical algorithms find patterns where science cannot.\nThe best practical example of this is the shotgun gene sequencing by J. Craig Venter. Enabled by high-speed sequencers and supercomputers that statistically analyze the data they produce, Venter went from sequencing individual organisms to sequencing entire ecosystems. In 2003, he started sequencing much of the ocean, retracing the voyage of Captain Cook. And in 2005 he started sequencing the air. In the process, he discovered thousands of previously unknown species of bacteria and other life-forms.\nIf the words \"discover a new species\" call to mind Darwin and drawings of finches, you may be stuck in the old way of doing science. Venter can tell you almost nothing about the species he found. He doesn't know what they look like, how they live, or much of anything else about their morphology. He doesn't even have their entire genome. All he has is a statistical blip — a unique sequence that, being unlike any other sequence in the database, must represent a new species.\nThis sequence may correlate with other sequences that resemble those of species we do know more about. In that case, Venter can make some guesses about the animals — that they convert sunlight into energy in a particular way, or that they descended from a common ancestor. But besides that, he has no better model of this species than Google has of your MySpace page. It's just data. By analyzing it with Google-quality computing resources, though, Venter has advanced biology more than anyone else of his generation.\nThis kind of thinking is poised to go mainstream. In February, the National Science Foundation announced the Cluster Exploratory, a program that funds research designed to run on a large-scale distributed computing platform developed by Google and IBM in conjunction with six pilot universities. The cluster will consist of 1,600 processors, several terabytes of memory, and hundreds of terabytes of storage, along with the software, including IBM's Tivoli and open source versions of Google File System and MapReduce.1 Early CluE projects will include simulations of the brain and the nervous system and other biological research that lies somewhere between wetware and software.\nLearning to use a \"computer\" of this scale may be challenging. But the opportunity is great: The new availability of huge amounts of data, along with the statistical tools to crunch these numbers, offers a whole new way of understanding the world. Correlation supersedes causation, and science can advance even without coherent models, unified theories, or really any mechanistic explanation at all.\nThere's no reason to cling to our old ways. It's time to ask: What can science learn from Google?",

  "text": "40\nCode (or, How You Can Write Something Differently)\nFriedrich Kittler\nCodes—by name and by matter—are what determine us today, and what we\nmust articulate if only to avoid disappearing under them completely. They are\nthe language of our time precisely because the word and the matter code are\nmuch older, as I will demonstrate with a brief historical regression. And have\nno fear: I promise to arrive back at the present.\nImperium Romanum\nCodes materialize in processes of encryption, which is, according to Wolfgang\nCoy’s elegant defi nition, “from a mathematical perspective a mapping of a fi -\nnite set of symbols of an alphabet onto a suitable signal sequence.”1 This defi nition\nclarifi es two facts. Contrary to current opinion, codes are not a peculiarity\nof computer technology or genetic engineering; as sequences of signals over\ntime they are part of every communications technology, every transmission\nmedium. On the other hand, much evidence suggests that codes became conceivable\nand feasible only after true alphabets, as opposed to mere ideograms\nor logograms, had become available for the codifi cation of natural languages.\nThose alphabets are systems of identically recurring signs of a countable quantity,\nwhich map speech sounds onto letters more or less one- to- one and, hopefully,\ncompletely. A vocalic alphabet of a type such as Greek,2 justly praised\nfor being the “fi rst total analysis of a language,”3 does appear to be a prerequisite\nfor the emergence of codes, and yet, not a suffi cient one. For what the\nGreeks lacked (leaving out of consideration sporadic allusions in the work of\nAischylos, Aenas, Tacticus, and Plutarch to the use of secret writing4 was that\nsecond prerequisite of all coding, namely, developed communications technology.\nIt is anything but coincidental that our reports of the fi rst secret message\nsystems coincide with the rise of the Roman Empire. In his Lives of the Caesars,\nSuetonius—who himself served as secret scribe to a great emperor—recounts\ndiscovering encrypted letters among the personal fi les left behind by both the\ndivine Caesar and the divine Augustus. Caesar contented himself with moving\nall the letters of the Latin alphabet by four places, thus writing D instead\nof A, E instead of B, and so forth. His adoptive son Augustus, by contrast, is\nCode\n41\nreported to have merely skipped one letter, but a lack of mathematical discernment\nled him to replace the letter X, the last in his alphabet, by a double\nA.5 The purpose was obvious: When read aloud by those not called upon to\ndo so (and Romans were hardly the most literate of people), a stodgy jumble\nof consonants resulted. And as if such innovations in matters of encryption\nwere not suffi cient, Suetonius attributes to Caesar another invention immediately\nbeforehand—that of having written in several columns, or even separate\npages, reports to the Roman Senate on the Gallic campaign. Augustus is credited\nwith the illustrious deed of creating, with riders and relay posts, Europe’s\nfi rst strictly military express- mail system.6 In other words, the basis on which\ncommand, code, and communications technology coincided was the Empire,\nas opposed to merely the Roman Republic or shorthand writers like Cicero.\nImperium is the name of both the command and its effect: the world empire.\n“Command, control, communications, intelligence” was also the Pentagon’s\nimperial motto until very recently, when, due to the coincidence of communication\ntechnologies and Turing machines it was swapped for C4—“command,\ncontrol, communication, computers”—from Orontes to the Scottish headland,\nfrom Baghdad to Kabul.\nIt was the case, however, that imperia, the orders of the Emperor, were also\nknown as codicilla, the word referring to the small tablets of stripped wood\ncoated with wax in which letters could be inscribed. The etymon codex for its\npart—caudex in Old Latin and related to the German verb hauen (to hew)—in\nthe early days of the Empire assumed the meaning of “book,” whose pages\ncould, unlike papyrus scrolls, for the fi rst time be leafed through. And that\nwas how the word that interests us here embarked on its winding journey to\nthe French and English languages. From Imperator Theodosius to Empereur\nNapoleon, “code” was simply the name of the bound book of law, and codifi\ncation became the word for the judicial- bureaucratic act needed to arrest in\na single collection of laws the torrents of imperial dispatches or commands\nthat for centuries had rushed along the express routes of the Empire. Message\ntransmission turned into data storage,7 pure events into serial order. And even\ntoday the Codex Theodosius and Codex Iustinianus continue to bear a code\nof ancient European rights and obligations in those countries where Anglo-\nAmerican common law does not happen to be sweeping the board. In the\nCorpus Iuris, after all, copyrights and trademarks are simply meaningless, regardless\nof whether they protect a codex or a code.\nCode\n42\nNation- States\nThe question that remains is why the technical meaning of the word “code”\nwas able to obscure the legal meaning to such a degree. As we know, contemporary\nlegal systems regularly fail to grasp codes in the fi rst place and, in consequence,\nto protect them, be it from robbers and purchasers or, conversely,\nfrom their discoverers and writers. The answer seems to be simple. What we\nhave been calling a code since the secret writings of Roman emperors to the\narcana imperii of the modern age was known as a “cipher” from the late Middle\nAges onward. For a long time the term code was understood to refer to very\ndifferent cryptographic methods whereby words could still be pronounced,\nbut obscure or innocuous words simply replaced the secret ones. Cipher, by\ncontrast, was another name for the zero, which at that time reached Europe\nfrom India via Baghdad and put sifr (Arabic: “emptiness”) into mathematicaltechnical\npower. Since that time, completely different sets of characters have\nbeen devised (in sharp contrast to the invention of Greek for speech sounds\nand numbers: on one side of language the alphabet of the people, on the other\nthe numbers of the bearers of secrets—the name of which spelled the Arabic\nsifr once again. Separate character sets, however, are productive. Together they\nbrew wondrous creatures that would never have occurred to the Greeks or Romans.\nWithout modern algebra there would be no encoding; without Gutenberg’s\nprinting press, no modern cryptology. In 1462 or 1463, Battista Leone\nAlberti, the inventor of linear perspective, was struck by two plain facts. First,\nthat the frequency of occurrence of phonemes or letters varies from language to\nlanguage, a fact which is proved, according to Alberti, by Gutenberg’s letter\ncase. From the frequency of shifted letters as they were written by Caesar and\nAugustus, cryptanalysis can heuristically derive the clear text of the encrypted\nmessage. Second, it is therefore insuffi cient to encrypt a message by shifting\nall the letters by the same number of places. Alberti’s proposal that every new\nletter in the clear text be accompanied by an additional place- shift in the secret\nalphabet was followed up until World War II.8 One century after Alberti,\nFrançois Viète, the founder of modern algebra, and also a cryptologist in the\nservice of Henry IV, intertwined number and letter more closely still. Only\nsince Viète have there been equations containing unknowns and universal coeffi\ncients written with numbers encoded as letters.9 This is still the work method\nof anybody who writes in a high- level programming language that likewise allocates\nvariables (in a mathematically more or less correct manner) to alpha-\nCode\n43\nnumeric signs, as in equations. On this basis—Alberti’s polyalphabetic code,\nViète’s algebra, and Leibniz’ differential calculus—the nation- states of the\nmodern age were able to technically approach modernity.\nGlobal Message Traffi c\nModernity began, however, with Napoleon. As of 1794, messengers on horseback\nwere replaced by an optical telegraph which remote- controlled France’s\narmies with secret codes. In 1806, the laws and privileges surviving from the\nold days were replaced by the cohesive Code Napoléon. In 1838, Samuel Morse\nis said to have inspected a printing plant in New York in order—taking a\nleaf from Alberti’s book—to learn from the letter case which letters occurred\nmost frequently and therefore required the shortest Morse signals.10 For the\nfi rst time a system of writing had been optimized according to technical criteria—\nthat is, with no regard to semantics—but the product was not yet known\nas Morse code. The name was bestowed subsequently in books known as Universal\nCode Condensers, which offered lists of words that could be abbreviated\nfor global cable communications, thus reducing the length, and cost, of telegrams,\nand thereby encrypting the sender’s clear text for a second time. What\nused to be called deciphering and enciphering has since then been referred to\nas decoding and encoding. All code processed by computers nowadays is therefore\nsubject to Kolmogorov’s test: Input is bad if it is longer than its output;\nboth are equally long in the case of white noise; and a code is called elegant\nif its output is much longer than itself. The twentieth century thus turned a\nthoroughly capitalist money- saving device called “code condenser” into highest\nmathematical stringency.\nThe Present Day—Turing\nAll that remains to ask is how the status quo came about or, in other words,\nhow mathematics and encryption entered that inseparable union that rules our\nlives. That the answer is Alan Turing should be well known today. The Turing\nmachine of 1936, as the principle controller of any computer, solved a basic\nproblem of the modern age: how to note with fi nitely long and ultimately whole\nnumbers the real, and therefore typically infi nitely long, numbers on which\ntechnology and engineering have been based since Viète’s time. Turing’s machine\nproved that although this task could not be accomplished for all real\nCode\n44\nnumbers, it was achievable for a crucial subset, which he dubbed computable\nnumbers.11 Since then a fi nite quantity of signs belonging to a numbered alphabet\nwhich can, as we know, be reduced to zero and one, has banished the\ninfi nity of numbers.\nNo sooner had Turing found his solution than war demanded its cryptanalytical\napplication. As of spring 1941 in Britannia’s Code and Cipher School,\nTuring’s proto- computers almost decided the outcome of the war by successfully\ncracking the secret codes of the German Wehrmacht, which, to its own\ndetriment, had remained faithful to Alberti. Today, at a time when computers\nare not far short of unravelling the secrets of the weather or the genome—physical\nsecrets, that is to say, and increasingly often biological ones, too—we all\ntoo often forget that their primary task is something different. Turing himself\nraised the question of the purpose for which computers were actually created,\nand initially stated as the primary goal the decoding of plain human language:\nOf the above possible fi elds the learning of languages would be the most impressive,\nsince it is the most human of these activities. This fi eld seems, however, to depend\nrather too much on sense organs and locomotion to be feasible. The fi eld of cryptography\nwill perhaps be the most rewarding. There is a remarkably close parallel between\nthe problems of the physicist and those of the cryptographer. The system on which a\nmessage is enciphered corresponds to the laws of the universe, the intercepted messages\nto the evidence available, the keys for a day or a message to important constants which\nhave to be determined. The correspondence is very close, but the subject matter of\ncryptography is very easily dealt with by discrete machinery, physics not so easily.12\nConclusions\nCondensed into telegraphic style, Turing’s statement thus reads: Whether everything\nin the world can be encoded is written in the stars. The fact that\ncomputers, since they too run on codes, can decipher alien codes is seemingly\nguaranteed from the outset. For the past three- and- a- half millennia, alphabets\nhave been the prototype of everything that is discrete. But it has by no means\nbeen proven that physics, despite its quantum theory, is to be computed solely\nas a quantity of particles and not as a layering of waves. And the question remains\nwhether it is possible to model as codes, down to syntax and semantics,\nall the languages that make us human and from which our alphabet once\nemerged in the land of the Greeks.\nCode\n45\nThis means that the notion of code is as overused as it is questionable. If\nevery historical epoch is governed by a leading philosophy, then the philosophy\nof code is what governs our own, and so code—harking back to its root,\n“codex”—lays down the law for one and all, thus aspiring to a function that\nwas, according to the leading philosophy of the Greeks, exercised exclusively\nby Aphrodite.13 But perhaps code means nothing more than codex did at one\ntime: the law of precisely that empire which holds us in subjection and forbids\nus even to articulate this sentence. At all events, the major research institutions\nthat stand to profi t most from such announcements proclaim with\ntriumphant certainty that there is nothing in the universe, from the virus to\nthe Big Bang, which is not code. One should therefore be wary of metaphors\nthat dilute the legitimate concept of code, such as when, for instance, in the\ncase of DNS, it was not possible to fi nd a one- to- one correspondence between\nmaterial elements and information units as Lily Ray discovered in the case of\nbioengineering. As a word that in its early history meant “displacement” or\n“transferral”—from letter to letter, from digit to letters, or vice versa—code is\nthe most susceptible of all to faulty communication. Shining in the aura of the\nword code one now fi nds sciences that do not even master their basic arithmetic\nor alphabet, let alone cause something to turn into something different as opposed\nto merely, as in the case of metaphors, go by a different name. Therefore,\nonly alphabets in the literal sense of modern mathematics should be known as\ncodes, namely one- to- one, fi nite sequences of symbols, kept as short as possible\nbut gifted, thanks to a grammar, with the incredible ability to infi nitely reproduce\nthemselves: Semi- Thue groups, Markov chains,14 Backus- Naur forms,\nand so forth. That, and that alone, distinguishes such modern alphabets from\nthe familiar one that admittedly spelled out our languages and gave us Homer’s\npoetry15 but cannot get the technological world up and running the way\ncomputer code now does. For while Turing’s machine was able to generate real\nnumbers from whole numbers as required, its successors have—in line with\nTuring’s daring prediction—taken command.16 Today, technology puts code\ninto the practice of realities, that is to say: it encodes the world.\nI cannot say whether this means that language has already been vacated as\nthe House of Existence. Turing himself, when he explored the technical feasibility\nof machines learning to speak, assumed that this highest art, speech,\nwould be learned not by mere computers but by robots equipped with sensors,\neffectors, that is to say, with some knowledge of the environment. However,\nthis new and adaptable environmental knowledge in robots would remain\nCode\n45\nThis means that the notion of code is as overused as it is questionable.

The so- called “hidden layers” in today’s neuronal networks present a\ngood, if still trifl ing, example of how far computing procedures can stray from\ntheir design engineers, even if everything works out well in the end. Thus,\neither we write code that in the manner of natural constants reveals the determinations\nof the matter itself, but at the same time pay the price of millions\nof lines of code and billions of dollars for digital hardware; or else we leave the\ntask up to machines that derive code from their own environment, although\nwe then cannot read—that is to say: articulate—this code. Ultimately, the\ndilemma between code and language seems insoluble. And anybody who has\nwritten code even only once, be it in a high- level programming language or\nassembly, knows two very simple things from personal experience. For one, all\nwords from which the program was by necessity produced and developed only\nlead to copious errors and bugs; for another, the program will suddenly run\nproperly when the programmer’s head is emptied of words. And in regard to\ninterpersonal communications, that can only mean that self- written code can\nscarcely be passed on with spoken words.

With this\nphrase, he aptly articulated the quintessential nature and function of humanism:\nIt is telecommunication in the medium of print to underwrite friendship. That which\nhas been known since the days of Cicero as humanism is in the narrowest and widest\nsenses a consequence of literacy. Ever since philosophy began as a literary genre, it has\nrecruited adherents by writing in an infectious way about love and friendship. Not only\nis it about love of wisdom: it is also an attempt to move others to this love. That\nwritten philosophy has managed from its beginning more than 2500 years ago until the\npresent day to remain communicable is a result of its capacity to make friends through\nits texts. It has been reinscribed like a chain letter through the generations, and despite\nall the errors of reproductionöindeed, perhaps because of such errorsöit has\nrecruited its copyists and interpreters into the ranks of brotherhood.\nThe most important link in this chain of transmission was without doubt the\nreception of the Greek message by the Romans, for the Roman adoption of the Greek\ntexts made them available to the empire and mediated, through the fall of the Roman\nwest, their accessibility to later European cultures. Certainly, the Greek authors must\nhave wondered what kind of friends would one day present themselves in response to\ntheir letters. It is one of the rules of the game of literate culture that the senders cannot\nknow their eventual recipients in advance. Nonetheless, the authors committed them-\nselves to the adventure of sending off their letters to unidentified friends. Without the\ntranscription of Greek philosophy in transportable form, the messages we know as\ntradition could never have been sent; but, without the Greek tutors who placed\nthemselves at the disposal of the Romans to help with the deciphering of the letters\nfrom Greece, the Romans would never have managed to make friends with the senders\nof the texts. Friendship at a distance required both: the letters and their deliverymen\nor interpreters. On the other hand, without the willingness of the Roman readers\nto be seduced by the missives of the Greeks, there would have been no recipients:\nRules for the Human Zoo: a response to the Letter on Humanism\nPeter Sloterdijk\nFrom Nicht gerettet: Versuche nach Heidegger (Suhrkamp, 2001) pp 302 ^ 333;\nTranslated by Mary Varney Rorty, Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics, Stanford School\nof Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, USA\nEnvironment and Planning D: Society and Space 2009, volume 27, pages 12 ^ 28\nAbstract. Rules for the Human Zoo, also known as the Elmauer Rede, originally appeared in 1999 in\nthe newspaper Die Zeit and was subsequently published by Suhrkamp in 2001. In this response\nto Heidegger's Letter on Humanism, Sloterdijk poses the basic question about the purpose of politics,\ngovernance, and civic solidarity. On the one hand, since Plato, politics has been conceived in part as\nconcerned with the necessity of `taming' humans into being good citizens. Sloterdijk thus follows\nNietzsche and Heidegger in portraying humanism as one side in a ``constant battle ... between\nbestializing and taming tendencies''. It is in the Hobbesian state of nature that humans are\n`wolves' to each other; but who turns the wolves into friendly, loyal dogs? Humanism has claimed,\naccording to Sloterdijk, that it is ``reading the right books'' which ``calms the inner beast''. It is the\ngreat books, the ``thick letters'' from one great thinker to another, that provide the ``model presented\nby the wise'', which enables ``the care of man by man''. At the present, Sloterdijk argues, we appear\nto have been abandoned by the wise. It is no longer the humanist but the archivist who bothers to\nlook up the old, thick letters. Humanism thus gives way to archivism.\ndoi:10.1068/dst3\nand, had the Romans with their extraordinary receptivity not come into play, the\nGreek message would never have reached western Europe, which retains to this day\nan interest in humanism. There would be neither the phenomenon of humanism, nor\nany form of Latin philosophy worth taking seriously, much less any vernacular\nnational philosophical culture. When today we speak in the German language of\nhumanistic concerns, it is possible not least of all because of the willingness of the\nRomans to read the writings of Greek teachers as though they were letters to friends\nin Italy.\nIf one considers the epochal results of the Greco-Roman mail, it becomes evident\nthat it has a particular relationship to the writing, sending, and receipt of philosophical\nwritings. Apparently, the writer of this type of love letter sends his work out into the\nworld without knowing the recipientöor, even if he knows him, he is conscious that\nthe transmission transcends him and might provoke an unknown number of chances\nof friendship with nameless, perhaps even yet unborn, readers. Erotically seen, the\nhypothetical friendship of the writer of books and letters with the recipients of his\nmessages represents a case of love at a distanceöand this entirely in the sense of\nNietzsche, who knew that writing is the power to transmit love not only to one's\nnearest and dearest, but also, through the next person encountered, into the unknown,\ndistant, future life.Writing not only creates a telecommunicative bridge between known\nfriends, who at the time of the transmission live in a geographical proximity to one\nanother; but it sets in motion an unpredictable process. It shoots an arrow in the air,\ndescribed in the words of old European alchemists as an actio in distans, with the\nobjective of revealing an unknown friend and enticing him into the circle of friends.\nIn fact, the reader who sits down to a thick book can approach it as an invitation to\na gathering; and should he be moved by the contents, he thereby enters the circle of the\nCalled, making himself available to receive the message.\nThus we can trace the communitarian fantasy that lies at the root of all humanism\nback to the model of a literary society, in which participation through reading the\ncanon reveals a common love of inspiring messages. At the heart of humanism so\nunderstood we discover a cult or club fantasy: the dream of the portentous solidarity\nof those who have been chosen to be allowed to read. In the ancient worldöindeed,\nuntil the dawn of the modern nation-statesöthe power of reading actually did mean\nsomething like membership of a secret elite; linguistic knowledge once counted in\nmany places as the provenance of sorcery. In Middle English the word `glamour'\ndeveloped out of the word `grammar'.(1) The person who could read would be thought\neasily capable of other impossibilities. The humanists are initially no more than the cult\nof the literate: and in this, as in other sects, expansionist and universalist projects\nappeared. Where the literate were imaginative and unsophisticated, grammatical or\nliterary mysticism arose, such as the Kabala, which purported to attain insight into\nthe Book of Creation.(2) Where, on the other hand, humanism was pragmatic and\nprogrammatic, as in the gymnasium ideology of the bourgeois nation-state of the\n19th and 20th centuries, the pattern of the literary society became the norm of political\nsociety. From then on people organized themselves as literary groups drawn together\nonly by their common reading, which eventually developed into a literary canon\ninto which one was initiated: a canon associated with national boundaries. In addition\nto the classical authors common to all of Europe, authors of national and modern\n(1) The expression for magic comes from the word for grammar.\n(2) It is the great insight of the Golem legend that the secret of life is intimately connected with the\nphenomenon of writing (see Idel, 1990). In the forward to Sloterdijk (2001), Henri Allan (2001) refers\nto a paper by the United States President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in\nMedicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research (1982), whose editor refers to the Golem legend.\nRules for the Human Zoo: a response to the Letter on Humanism 13\nclassics were mobilized, whose letters to the public were turned, through booksellers\nand higher education, into effective forces for nation building. What are modern\nnations except the effective fictions of literate publics, who have become a like-minded\ncollective of friends through reading the same books? Universal obligatory military\nservice for young men and the universal obligation to read the classics for young\npeople of both genders were characteristic of the classical bourgeois state, recalling\na period of armed and literate humanity on which the new and old conservatives\nof today look back, simultaneously helpless and nostalgic and completely unable to\nprovide a media theoretical justification for the importance of a literary canon. (If one\nwants to see how that is currently playing out, consider how deplorable the results\nwere of a recently attempted national debate in Germany over the supposed necessity\nof establishing a new literary canon.)\nIn fact, it was from 1789 to 1945 that reading-friendly national humanism had its\ngreatest period of influence. At its center, powerful and self-satisfied, resided the caste\nof classical and modern philologists, who were entrusted with the task of initiating\neach new generation into the circle of recipients of the authorized standard thick\nletters. The power of the professor in this period, and the key role of the philologists,\nhad its root in their privileged knowledge of the authors who were considered senders\nof the letters that undergirded solidarity. As far as its content went, national humanism\nwas nothing other than the power to incline the young toward the classics and to\nreaffirm the universal validity of the national canon.(3) Thus the nation-state itself\nwas to some extent a literary and postal product: the fiction of a fateful friendship with\ndistant peoples and sympathetically united readers of bewitching common (or individual)\nauthors.\nIf this period seems today to have irredeemably vanished, it is not because people\nhave through decadence become unwilling to follow their national literary curriculum.\nThe epoch of nationalistic humanism has come to an end because the art of writing\nlove-inspiring letters to a nation of friends, however professionally it is practised, is no\nlonger sufficient to form a telecommunicative bond between members of a modern\nmass society. Because of the formation of mass culture through the mediaöradio in the\nFirst World War and television after 1945, and even more through the contemporary\nweb revolutionöthe coexistence of people in the present societies has been established\non new foundations. These are, as it can uncontrovertibly be shown, clearly post-\nliterary, postepistolary, and thus posthumanistic. Anyone who thinks the prefix `post' in\nthis formulation is too dramatic can replace it with the adverb `marginal'. Thus our\nthesis: modern societies can produce their political and cultural synthesis only margin-\nally through literary, letter-writing, humanistic media. Of course, that does not mean\nthat literature has come to an end, but it has split itself off and become a sui generis\nsubculture, and the days of its value as bearer of the national spirit have passed. The\nsocial synthesis is no longeröand is no longer seen to beöprimarily a matter of books\nand letters. New means of political ^ cultural telecommunication have come into\nprominence, which have restricted the pattern of script-born friendship to a limited\nnumber of people. The period when modern humanism was the model for schooling\nand education has passed, because it is no longer possible to retain the illusion that\npolitical and economic structures could be organized on the amiable model of literary\nsocieties.\nThis disillusionment, appearing after World War I in the awareness of people who\nthemselves had had a humanistic education, has a particularly convoluted history,\nmarked by twists and turns. For, exactly at the cruel end of the era of national\n(3) And it was also the power to reaffirm the national validity of the universal canon.\n14 P Sloterdijk\nhumanism, in the unparalleled gloom of the years after 1945, the humanistic model\nexperienced a last efflorescence. There was an artificially promoted and reflexive\nrenaissance that has provided the model for later reanimations of humanism. If the\nbackground were not so dark, one would be tempted to speak of a madness, of a\ncompetition in self-deception. In the fundamentalism of the years after 1945, under-\nstandably, perhaps many people found themselves unable to go from the horrors\nof war into a society that represented itself once again as a peaceful collection of\nbook-friendsöas though the Goethe-Jugend could eradicate the memory of the\nHitler-Jugend. At that time, it seemed to many to be possible to reestablish in con-\njunction with the newly revived Latin classics a second, biblical, base for European\nculture, thus grounding that culture, once again being described as `occidental', in\nChristian humanism. This confused neohumanism, looking through Weimar towards\nRome, was a dream of the salvation of the European soul through a radicalized\nbibliophilia, a determinedly hopeful infatuation with the civilizing, the humanizing,\npower of classical readingöan attempt, if we can take the liberty of so describing it,\nto conjoin Cicero and Christ as coeval classics.\nIn this postwar humanism, however illusory it might have been, a motive is\nrevealed, without which the humanistic tendency in general cannot be understood,\nwhether in the days of the Romans or in the age of the modem bourgeois nation-state.\nHumanism as a word and as a movement always has a goal, a purpose, a rationale: it is\nthe commitment to save men from barbarism. It is clear that exactly those times which\nhave experienced the barbarizing potential that is released in power struggles between\npeoples are the times in which the demand for humanism is loudest and most strident.\nAnyone who is asking today about the future of humanity and about the methods of\nhumanization wants to know if there is any hope of mastering the contemporary\ntendency towards the bestialization of humanity. It is disturbing that bestialization,\nnow as ever, tends to accompany displays of great power: whether as open warfare or\nraw imperial power, or in the daily degradation of human beings in entertainments\noffered in the media. The Romans influenced Europe by providing archetypes for\nbothöon the one hand, their overweening militarism; on the other, their precedent-\nsetting entertainment industry of bloody games. The latent message of humanism,\nthen, is the taming of men. And its hidden thesis is: reading the right books calms\nthe inner beast.\nThe phenomenon of humanism deserves attention today primarily because it\nreminds us (however indirectly and embarrassingly) that human beings in high culture\nare constantly subjected simultaneously to two pressures, which we will here for\nsimplicity's sake term the `constraining' and the `unconstraining', or `disinhibiting'. It is\npart of the credo of humanism that human beings are `creatures capable of suggestion',\nand that it is therefore extremely important to expose them to the right kinds of\ninfluences. The label of humanism reminds us (with apparent innocuousness) of the\nconstant battle for humanity that reveals itself as a contest between bestializing and\ntaming tendencies.\nIn the age of Cicero the two influences were easy to identify, for each of them\nhad their characteristic medium. For the bestializing, the Romans, in their amphi-\ntheaters, their animal-baiting, their battles to the death, and their public hangings, had\nestablished the most efficient mass-media net in antiquity. In the raging stadiums of the\nMediterranean the unconstrained homo inhumanus came into his own in a way seen never\nbefore and only seldom afterwards.(4) During the time of the Caesars the provision of the\n(4) The comparable ascension of modern mass culture to the heights of bestiality-consumerism was\nattained in the genre of Chain Saw Massacre movies (see Edmundson, 1997).\nRules for the Human Zoo: a response to the Letter on Humanism 15\nRoman masses with bestializing spectacles became an unavoidable, routinely executed\ntechnique of control that, thanks to Juvenal's bread-and-circuses description, is\nremembered even today. Ancient humanism can be understood only when it is grasped\nas one opponent in a media contest: that is, as the resistance of the books against\nthe amphitheater, and the opposition of the humanizing, patient-making, sensitizing\nphilosophical reading against the dehumanizing, impatient, unrestrained, sensation-\nmongering and excitement-mongering of the stadium. What the educated Romans\ncalled humanitas would have been unthinkable without the need to abstain from the\nmass culture of the theaters of cruelty. Should the humanist himself occasionally stray\ninto the roaring crowd it is only to assure himself that he is also a human being and\ncan thus be infected by bestialization. He returns from the theater to his house, shamed\nby his involuntary participation in the contagious sensations, and can now claim that\nnothing human is foreign to him. But, thereby, it is affirmed that humanity itself\nconsists in choosing to develop one's nature through the media of taming, and to\nforswear bestialization. The meaning of this choice of media is to wean oneself from\none's own bestiality and to establish a distance between yourself and the dehumanizing\nescalation of the roaring mob in the arena.\nSo it becomes clear: The question of humanism is more than the bucolic assump-\ntion that reading improves us. It is, rather, no less than an issue of anthropodicy: that\nis, a characterization of man with respect to his biological indeterminacy and his moral\nambivalence. Above all, however, from now on the question of how a person can\nbecome a true or real human being becomes unavoidably a media question, if we\nunderstand by media the means of communion and communication by which human\nbeings attain to that which they can and will become.\nIn the fall of 1946öin the darkest valley of the European postwar crisisöthe\nphilosopher Martin Heidegger wrote his now famous Letter on Humanism (1977\n([1946])öa text that at first glance could also be understood as a thick letter to friends.\nBut the attempt at friendship that this letter marshaled was no longer simply that of\nbourgeois openhanded communication, and the concept of friendship that was invoked\nthrough this demanding philosophical missive was no longer that of a communication\nbetween a national public and its classicist. Heidegger knew, as he formulated this\nletter, that he had to speak with a bellow and write with an angry hand, and that\na preestablished harmony between the author and his readers could in no respect still\nbe treated as a given. At this point in time he did not know if he had friends; and, even\nif he did, their friendship needed to be established anew, on a different basis from\neverything that had previously counted as grounds for friendship within the nation and\nwithin Europe. In any case, one thing is clear: what the philosopher in the fall of the\nyear 1946 put to paper was not a lecture on the nation or on any extant Europe:\nit was a complicated, simultaneously careful and clever, attempt of an author (seldom\nattempted by a person of Heidegger's provincial inclinations) to introduce his message\nto a positively inclined recipientöa foreigner, a potential friend at a distance, a young\nthinker who had taken the liberty of allowing himself to be ensorcelled by a German\nphilosopher during the German occupation of France.\nSo: a new method of making friends? Another venture towards eliciting the like-\nminded and similarly inclined through a randomly sent essay? Another method of\nhumanization? Another social agreement among bearers of a less provincial, no longer\nnationalistic, humanism? Of course, Heidegger's enemies have not hesitated to suggest\nthat the sly little man from Messkirch instinctively seized the first opportunity to\nrehabilitate his reputation. He cunningly utilized the approach of one of his French\nadmirers to transform his political ambiguity into high mystical insight. This suspicion\nmight seem suggestive and plausible; but it underestimates the conceptual and strategic\n16 P Sloterdijk\nevent that the Letter on Humanismöfirst sent to Jean Beaufret in Paris, and later\ntranslated and published as an essayörepresented. For, in this essay, which he chose\nto present as a letter, Heidegger analyzed and criticized the characteristics of European\nhumanism; and, in so doing, he opened up a transhumanistic or posthumanistic space\nfor thought, one in which a considerable portion of the philosophical consideration on\nman has taken place ever since.(5)\nFrom the letter of Jean Beaufret, Heidegger took as his focus one phrase: how can\na sense be restored to the word `humanism'? The letter to the young Frenchman gently\nreproves the questioner, as is seen most clearly in a challenge repeated twice:\n``This question proceeds from your intention to retain the word `humanism'. I wonder\nwhether that is necessary. Or is the damage caused by all such terms still not\nsufficiently obvious?'' (1977, page 195).\n``Your question not only presupposes a desire to retain the word `humanism', but\nalso contains an admission that this word has lost its sense'' (page 224).\nThis reveals part of Heidegger's strategy: the word `humanism' must be abandoned if\nthe real task of thinking, which has shown itself to have been exhausted in the human-\nistic or metaphysical tradition, is to be furthered in its original unity and irresistibility.\nTo put the point sharply: Why should humanism and its general philosophical\nself-representation be seen as the solution for humanity, when the catastrophe of the\npresent clearly shows that it is man himself, along with his systems of metaphysical\nself-improvement and self-clarification, that is the problem? This turning of the\nquestion back on Beaufret is not entirely without pedagogical cruelty, for it reveals to\nthe student the false answer contained within the question. But it is also seriously\nmeant, for the three contemporary remedies for the European maladies of 1945ö\nChristianity, Marxism, and existentialism, which differed from one another only in\ntheir superficial characteristicsöwere characterized as parallel varieties of humanism:\nor, more explicitly, as three ways and means of evading the last radicalization of the\nquestion about the essence of man.\nHeidegger offered to prepare the way for an end to the most radical omission of\nEuropean thoughtönamely, the refusal to pose the question of the Being of Man in the\nonly appropriate (that is, the existential ^ ontological) way. Or at least the author\nindicated his readiness to serve in whatever future situations might develop from the\nasking of the question when properly posed. With this apparently modest twist,\nHeidegger opened the possibility of cataclysmic consequences: Humanism, in its\nancient, in its Christian, as in its Enlightenment form, was revealed as the agent of a\n2000-year denial. It was accused of having prevented, through its swiftly provided,\napparently self-evident, and irrefutable characterization of the nature of man, the\ndevelopment of a more appropriate way to pose the question about the nature of\nman. Heidegger explained that his work after Sein und Zeit [1927] was directed against\nhumanism, not because it overvalued humanity, but because it did not value humanity\nhighly enough (1977, page 210). But what would it mean to value the essence of\nman highly enough? It would require first to renounce a habitual false denigration.\nThe question of the Being of Man will never be posed properly until we can distance\nourselves from the oldest, most enduring, and traditional product of European\nmetaphysics: the definition of man as rational animal. According to this definition,\nman is characterized as an animal enriched by a spiritual supplement. Heidegger's\nexistential ^ ontological analysis rejects this understanding of man, since for him the\n(5) This master stroke is misunderstood by those who see in Heidegger's onto-anthropology some-\nthing like an antihumanism, a tortured formulation that suggests something like a metaphysical\nform of misanthropy.\nRules for the Human Zoo: a response to the Letter on Humanism 17\nnature of man can never be expressed from a zoological or biological perspective, even\nwhen a spiritual or transcendental component is consistently added.\nOn this point Heidegger is completely adamant; indeed, he strides like an angry\nangel with crossed swords between beast and man, in order to deny any ontological\ncommonality between the two. In his antivitalistic and antibiological passion he allows\nhimself almost hysterical statements, as when he explains that it seems ``as if we are\nnearer to the nature of the divine than to the alien-ness of the animals'' (1977,\npage 206). At the heart of this antivitalistic passion lay the recognition that man is\ndifferentiated from animals in ontology, not in species or genus, so he cannot under\nany circumstances be considered an animal with a cultural or metaphysical addition.\nOn the contrary: the form of being of the human itself is different from all vegetable\nand animal beings, because man has a world and is in the world, while plants and\nanimals inhabit only a transitory environment.\nIf there is any philosophical reason for an essay on the value of the human, it is\nbecause man is called by Being, and, as Heidegger in his pastoral mode liked to say,\nis constituted so as to be the House of Being. That is why human beings have language;\nbut they possess it, according to Heidegger, not for their own sake, but only so that\nthey can understand each other and through this mutual understanding civilize each\nother.\n``Rather, language is the House of Being, in which man ek-sists by dwelling, in that\nhe belongs to the truth of Being, guarding it.\nSo the point is that in the determination of the humanity of man as ek-sistence\nwhat is essential is not man but Beingöas the dimension of the ecstasis of\nek-sistence'' (1977, page 213).\nIf we puzzle over this initially hermetic formulation we begin to understand why\nHeidegger was so certain that his criticism of humanism would not eventuate in an\ninhumanism. For insofar as he rejects the claim of humanism to have adequately\ndefined the humanity of man, and opposes to it his own onto-anthropology, he\nnonetheless indirectly retains the most important function of classical humanismö\nnamely, the befriending of man through the word of the otheröindeed, he radicalizes\nthis drive to befriend, and transfers it from mere pedagogy to the center of ontological\nconsciousness.\nThat is the meaning of the often cited and much ridiculed description of man as the\nshepherd of being. By using images of the pastoral and idyllic, Heidegger speaks of\nthe task of man, which is his being, and the nature of man from which his role springs,\nwhich is to shepherd being and to speak being. Certainly, man does not look toward\nbeing the way the ill man looks toward his bed but, rather as a shepherd looks after his\nherd in the fields, with the important difference that here, instead of a herd of sheep, it\nis the world as an open circumstance that is to be looked after. Furthermore, this task\nof oversight is not represented by Heidegger as one freely chosen in man's own interest;\nrather, men were set apart by Being itself as its shepherd. The place where this happens\nis the Clearing, die Lichtung, where Being appears as that which is there.\nWhat gave Heidegger the certainty that he had by this turnabout transcended and\nsurpassed humanism is the fact that, by understanding man as a clearing for Being, he\ninvolved him in taming and befriending much more deeply than could any humanistic\ndebestializing, or any love for texts that speak of love. By describing man as the\nshepherd and neighbor of Being and calling language the House of Being, he bound\nman into a relationship with Being that imposed radical constraints on his behavior.\nIt contained him, the shepherd, within the house or in its neighborhood. Heidegger\nsuggested a self-understanding that demanded of man more inactivity and receptivity than\nany comprehensive program of education had ever attempted. Man was subjugated\n18 P Sloterdijk\nto an ecstatic behavior that reached much further than the civil constraints of the\ntext-pious readers of the classical word. Heideggerian self-contained dwelling in\nthe house of language is characterized as a receptive listening to whatever it is that\nwill be said by Being. It requires a proximate listening, for which man must become\nmore passive, and tamer, than the humanist reading the classics. Heidegger wishes man\nto be more submissive than a mere good reader would be. He wishes to found a way of\nmaking friends in which he himself would no longer be seen only as a classicist or one\nauthor among others. It would be best if the public (consisting, naturally, of clueless\ninferiors) would recognize that Being itself had begun once again to speak, through\nhim, the tutor of the question of Being.\nBy this move, Heidegger elevated Being to the sole author of all important letters,\nand placed himself as their current scribe. Whoever speaks from such a position is\nallowed to call attention to stammers, and to publicize silence. Being thus sends the\nmost important letters. More precisely, it addresses them to spiritually advanced\nfriends, to receptive neighbors, to groups of silent herdsmen. But, so far as we can\nsee, no nations, not even alternative schools, can be derived from this circle of fellow\nshepherds and friends of Beingönot least because there can be no public canon of\nmanifestations of Being. So, until further notice, Heidegger's collected work stands\nas the measure and voice of the nameless Ur-author.\nThis dark communication reveals no way in which a society can be constructed out\nof neighbors of Being. Until something further develops, we must understand it as an\ninvisible congregation, a church of scattered singletons, each in his own way listening\nto the unknown and awaiting the word in which will be expressed whatever the Speaker\nreveals about language itself.(6) It is pointless to expand here upon the crypto-catholic\ncharacter of the Heideggerian objects of veneration. What is clear is that Heidegger's\ncritique of humanism suggests an attitude which directs men toward an asceticism that\ngoes far deeper than that achievable through any humanistic education. It is only\nthrough the power of this asceticism that a society of knowers beyond the humanistic\nliterary society could form. It would be a society of men who no longer placed humans\nat the center, because they had realized that men exist only as neighbors of Being, and\nnot as independent homeowners or as tenants in landlordless apartments. Humanism\ncannot contribute anything to this ascetic ideal as long as it remains fixated on the\nimage of strong men.\nThe humanistic friends of human authors lack the blessed grace that Being shows\nto those who have been touched and spoken to by it. For Heidegger there is no path\nfrom humanism to this acute ontological exercise in humility. He sees it rather as a\ncontribution to the history of the disarmament of subjectivity. Actually, Heidegger\ninterprets the historical world of Europe as the theater of militant humanism; it is\nthe battlefield on which human subjectivity, with portentous consequences, has acted\nout its domination over Being. From this perspective, humanism is seen as the natural\naccomplice of all possible tortures which could be inflicted in the name of human\nwell-being. In the tragic battle of the titans of the mid-century, between bolshevism,\nfascism, and Americanism, Heidegger saw only three varieties of the same anthro-\npocentric power, three candidates for a humanistically camoflagued form of world\ndomination (see Vietta, 1989). Fascism excluded itself from this competition by reveal-\ning that it despised the constraining values of peace and education more than its\nopponents did. Fascism is actually a metaphysics of disinhibitingömaybe also a\nform of disinhibiting of metaphysics. In Heidegger's view, fascism was a synthesis\n(6)Actually, it is equally difficult to imagine what a society composed only of deconstructionists\nwould look like, or one constituted only of Levinas students, who would constantly yield to the\nsuffering Other.\nRules for the Human Zoo: a response to the Letter on Humanism 19\nof humanism and bestialityöthat is, the paradoxical coincidence of restraint and\nlicense.\nIn the face of such weird criticisms and twists, it was very natural to re-pose the\nquestion of the basis for the taming and education of man. If today Heidegger's onto-\nlogical shepherds' gameöwhich even in its own day sounded odd and jarringöseems\ntotally anachronistic, it nonetheless serves to have articulated in all its painfulness and\nleftist tendencies the question of the age: What can tame man, when the role of human-\nism as the school for humanity has collapsed? What can tame men, when their previous\nattempts at self-taming have led primarily to power struggles? What can tame men,\nwhen, after all previous experiments to grow the species up, it remains unclear what\nit is to be a grown-up? Or is it simply no longer possible to pose the question of the\nconstraint and formation of mankind by theories of civilizing and upbringing?\nWe shall avoid following Heidegger's instructions that we stand transfixed at the\nendpoints of conscious thought.We shall try instead to characterize historically more\nprecisely the ecstatic clearing in which man allows himself to be bespoken by Being.\nIt will become clear that the human sojourn in the Clearing of being is not an\nontological primitive, which allows no further exploration; there is a history, reso-\nlutely ignored by Heidegger, of the entrance into the Clearing of beingöa social\nhistory of the openness of man to the Seinsfrage, and a historical progression in the\nclarification of ontological difference.\nSo, on the one hand, we must examine the natural history of Gelassenheit (letting\nbe, releasement), by virtue of which man becomes capable of worlds; and, on the other\nhand, recount the social history of taming, through which man became the being who\ncould pull himself together in order to speak the totality of Being.(7) The true story\nof the Clearing (from which a deeper, humanism-transcending understanding of man\nmust take its beginning) incorporates these two larger stories, which converge in\na single common perspective: namely, in the account of how the thinking animal\nbecame the thinking man. The first of these two stories gives an account of the\nadventure of humanization. It tells how, in the long period of prehuman development,\na type of creature born immature developed out of the species of live-born mammalian\nhumans. These, to speak paradoxically, entered their world with an ever-increasing\nexcess of animalian unpreparedness. This led to an anthropogenetic revolutionöthe\ntransformation of biological birth into the act of coming into the world. Because of his\nobstinate suspicion of anthropology, and in his desire to maintain the ontological\npurity of the beginning of Dasein and being-in-the-world, Heidegger did not take\nsufficient account of this explosion. For the fact that man is a creature that could\nbecome a being in the world is rooted in the characteristics of his species that reveal\nthemselves in the basic ideas of premature-born-ness, neoteny, and the chronic animal-\nian immaturity of man.(8) We could even go so far as to suggest that man is the being\nin which being an animal is separate from remaining an animal. Because of his\nshattered animality, the indeterminate being falls out of the environment and manages\nto develop a world in an ontological sense. Man was destined from the cradle for\nthis ek-static coming-into-the-world and orientation toward Being, the legacy of his\nevolutionary history. If man is in the world it is because he belongs to a movement\nthat brought him to the world and set him in it. He is the product of a super-birth that\ncreated from a nursling a worldling.\n(7)On the motivation of `gathering' see Schneider (1999, pages 44f ).\n(8) See the chapter ``Domestication of Being. On the Elucidation of the Clearing'', especially\nsection 3, ``The lightening thinking'', pages 167 ^ 211, in Sloterdijk (2001).\n20 P Sloterdijk\nSuch an exodus would create only psychotic animals were it not that concurrent\nwith the entrance into the World there is also an entrance from that world into what\nHeidegger terms the `House of Being'. The traditional languages of man made the\necstasy of Being-in-the-World endurable in that they showed man how his being in\nthe world could also be experienced as being-alongside-oneself. Insofar as the Lichtung\nis an event on the border between natural and cultural histories, human coming to the\nworld takes the form of a coming to language.(9)\nBut the history of the Clearing cannot be developed only as a tale of man moving\ninto the houses of language. For, as soon as speaking men gather into larger groups\nand not only connect themselves to linguistic houses but also build physical houses,\nthey enter the arena of domestication. They are now not only sheltered by their\nlanguage, but also tamed by their accommodations. In the Clearing, as its most\nobvious marks, appear the houses of men (as well as the temples of their gods and\nthe palaces of their masters). Historians of culture have made it clear that with\ndomesticity the relationship between men and animals changed. With the taming of\nmen by their houses the age of pets began as well. Their attachment to houses is not\nonly a question of civilizing, but also a matter of direction and upbringing.\nMen and petsöthe history of this weird cohabitation has not yet been properly\ntold, and philosophers up to the present day have not properly recognized what they\nneed to find in this history [one of the few exceptions is de Fontenay (1998) as well as\nMacho (1997a; 1997b)]. Only in a few places is the veil of philosophical silence about\nman, the house, and animals as a biopolitical unity lifted.What one would hear on the\nother side of that veil would be a whirlwind of references to problems that are so far\ntoo difficult for men. Among them, not the least difficult, is the close connection\nbetween domesticity and theory building, for one could go so far as to consider theory\nbuilding as one variety of home work, or even better as a type of home leisure; for\naccording to the ancient understanding of theory, it was like looking out of the window:\nessentially a form of contemplation. It is only in recent times, since knowledge began to\nbe understood as a form of power, that it became more clearly a form of work. In this\nsense, the windows of the Clearing were walls, behind which men became beings capable\nof theory. Taking strolls, in which movement and contemplation unite, derives as well\nfrom domesticity. Even Heidegger's contemplative wandering through fields and woods\nis a typical form of movement for someone who has a house to fall back on.\nBut these forays into the Clearing out of the safety of the house are only the\nharmless face of man's householding. The Clearing is at the same time a battleground\nand a place of decision and choice. And in these respects it is not possible to see only\nthe philosophical pastoral.Where there are houses, there are also decisions about who\nshall live in them. In fact, and through this fact, it is determined what type of com-\nmunity dwellers will be dominant. In the Clearing, it is revealed which enterprises are\nworth fighting for, as soon as men emerge as beings who form societies and erect\nsocial hierarchies. That master of dangerous thinking, Nietzsche, told us what it was\nreally all about when in the third part of Thus Spoke Zarathustra (2006), in the section\ntitled ``On the virtue that makes small'', he wrote:\n``For he [Zarathustra] wanted to learn what had transpired in the meantime among\nhuman beings; whether they had become bigger or smaller. And once he saw a row\nof new houses, and he was truly amazed, and he said:\n`What do these houses mean? Truly, no great soul has placed them here, as a\nparable of itself! ...\nAnd these parlors and chambers, can men go in and out here? ...'\n(9) I have somewhere else presented to what an extent and how much the ``Ins-Bild-Kommen''\n(To come into a representation/image) can be dealt with (see Sloterdijk, 1998; 1999).\nRules for the Human Zoo: a response to the Letter on Humanism 21\nAnd Zarathustra stood still and reflected. At last he said sadly, `Everything has\nbecome smaller!\nEverywhere I see lower gateways; whoever is like me can still pass through, butö\nhe has to stoop! ...\nI walk among these people and keep my eyes open; they have become smaller and are\nbecoming even smaller: but this is because of their teaching on happiness and virtue. ...\nA few of them will, but most of them are merely willed. ...\nRound, righteous and kind they are to one another, like grains of sand are round,\nrighteous and kind to one another.\nTo modestly embrace a small happinessöthat they call `resignation'... .\nAt bottom these simple ones want one simple thing: that no one harm them. ...\nTo them virtue is whatever makes modest and tame; this is how they made the wolf\ninto the dog and mankind himself into mankind's favorite pet' '' (pages 133 ^ 135).\nWithout doubt, buried in this rhapsodic poetry is a theoretical discourse about man as\na taming and nurturing power. From Zarathustra's perspective, modern men are\nprimarily profitable breeders who have made out of wild men the Last Men. It is clear\nthat this could not be done with humanistic education alone.With the thesis of men as\nbreeders of men, the humanistic horizons have been pried apart, so that the humanist\ncan no longer only think, but can move on to questions of taming and nurture.\nThe humanist directs himself to the human, and applies to him his taming, training,\neducational tools, convinced, as he is, of the necessary connection between reading,\nsitting, and taming.\nNietzsche, who read Darwin and Saint Paul equally carefully, thought to see\nbehind the horizon of scholarly man-taming a second, darker horizon. He perceived\na space in which the unavoidable battle over the direction of man-breeding would\nbeginöand this is the space of the other, the veiled, face of the Clearing. As\nZarathustra wandered through the city in which everyone had grown smaller, he\nsaw the results of a so-far profitable and uncontested breeding-politics. People had\nsucceeded in diminishing themselves through a collaboration of ethics and genetics.\nThey have domesticated themselves and have committed themselves to a breeding\nprogram aimed at a pet-like accommodation. From this insight springs Zarathustra's\nspecific criticism of humanism as a denial of the false harmlessness with which the\nmodern good man surrounds himself. Actually, it would not be a good thing if men\nbred themselves or other men for harmlessness. Nietzsche's suspicion of humanistic\nculture is intended to bring to light the secret of the domestication of humanity.\nHe wants to reveal, by name and function, the people who until now have had a\nmonopoly on the control of breedingöthe priests and teachers who pretend to be\nfriends of manöand to initiate a modern, momentous public battle between different\nbreeders and breeding programs.\nThis is the root of the basic conflict Nietzsche postulates for the future: the battle\nbetween those who wish to breed for minimization and those who wish to breed for\nmaximization of human function, or, as we might say, a battle between humanists and\nsuperhumanists. The image of the superman that is emblematic of Nietzsche's thought\nis not that of a release of repressions or a swerve into bestialization, as was imagined\nby the booted evil Nietzsche readers of the 1930s. Nor does it stand for a regression of\nhumanity back to what it was before the current status of house pet and church pet.\nWhen Nietzsche speaks of the u«bermensch he is imagining an era of the world far\nin the future.(10) He takes into consideration the previous millennia-long processes,\n(10) Fascist readers stubbornly misrepresented him, pretending that his distinction referred to them\nand the present day, describing the difference between themselves and ordinary men.\n22 P Sloterdijk\nthe application of intimate constraints of breeding, taming, and raising, through which\nuntil now human beings have been producedöa production, admittedly, that knew\nhow to make itself virtually invisible and that succeeded in the project of domestication\nunder the disguise of schooling.\nWith this suggestionöand it is neither possible nor desirable to see it as more than\na suggestionöNietzsche opened a spacious arena within which the specification of the\nman of the future must be played out, whether or not we return to the concept of\nthe u«bermensch. It may well be that Zarathustra was the spokesman of a philosophical\nhysteria whose infectious effect is today, and perhaps forever, banished. But the dis-\ncourse about difference and the control of taming and breedingöindeed, just\nthe suggestion about the decline of awareness of how human beings are produced,\nand intimations of anthropotechnologyöthese are prospects from which we may not,\nin the present day, avert our eyes, lest they once again be presented as harmless.\nNietzsche probably went too far when he suggested that the defanging of men was\nthe premeditated project of a group of pastoral breedersöthat is, a project of clerical\nor Pauline insight that foresaw everything that men might be capable of if they were\nfree and left to themselves, and so instituted compensatory and preventative measures\nagainst it. That would certainly be a hybrid thought, because for one thing he imagined\na potential breeding project being carried out in much too short a periodöas if only a\nfew generations of priest craft were required to turn wolves into dogs or ordinary men\ninto professors in Basel (cf Dufour, 1999). It is implausible as well because it presup-\nposes a conscious agent, where actually a breeding without breeder, an agentless\nbiocultural drift, is more likely. Still, even after we bracket the exaggeration and fierce\nanticlericalism, there remains of Nietzsche's idea a solid kernel, sufficient to encourage\nreflection on the humanistic defanging of humanity.\nThe domestication of man is the great unthinkable, from which humanism from\nantiquity to the present has averted its eyes. Recognizing this suffices to plunge us into\ndeep waters. And in those deep waters we are flooded with the realization that at no\ntime was it, or will it be, possible to accomplish the taming and befriending of men\nwith letters alone. Certainly, reading was a great power for the upbringing and\nimprovement of men. It still is today, to some extent. But, nonetheless, breeding,\nwhatever form it may have taken, was always present as the power behind the mirror.\nReading and breeding have more to do with each other than cultural historians are\nable or willing to admit. Even if it is impossible to adduce evidence for this suspicion,\nor to pin down the relation between the two, the connection is nonetheless more than\na random suggestion.\nLiteracy itself, at least until the very recent accomplishment of universal literacy,\nhas had a sharply selective sorting effect. It sharply divided our culture and created\na yawning gulf between the literate and the illiterate, a gulf that in its insuperability\namounted almost to a species differentiation. If, despite Heidegger's prohibition, one\nwanted to speak anthropologically, one could define humans of the historical period\nas animals, some of whom could read or write. By taking a single step further, one\ncould define them as animals that reproduce or breed themselves, while other animals\nare bredöan idea that has been current as part of Europe's pastoral folklore since\nPlato. This is similar to Nietzsche's claim in Zarathustra that few of the people in\nsmall houses will to live there. Most are willed into them. They are objects, not agents,\nof selection.\nIt is characteristic of our technological and anthropotechnological age that people\nwillingly fall more and more into the active, or agent, side of selection, without having\nto be forced into the role of selectors. As evidence, it can be noted that there is\nsomething suspicious in the power of the vote, and it will soon become one way of\nRules for the Human Zoo: a response to the Letter on Humanism 23\navoiding guilt for people to explicitly refuse to exercise the power of selection that they\nactually have available to them [Sloterdijk (1989), remarks on the ethics of acts of\nomission and `retarding' as a progressive function]. But, as soon as an area of knowl-\nedge has developed, people begin to look bad if they still, as in their earlier period of\ninnocence, allow a higher power, whether it is the gods, chance, or other people, to act\nin their stead, as they might have in earlier periods when they had no alternative.\nBecause abstaining or omitting will eventually be insufficient, it will become necessary\nin the future to formulate a codex of anthropotechnology and to confront this fact\nactively. Such a codex will retroactively alter the meaning of the old humanism, for it\nwill be made explicit, and codified, that humanity is not just the friendship of man with\nman, but that man has become the higher power for man.\nNietzsche was conscious of something like this when he dared to consider himself,\nin respect of his influence, a force majeure. One can understand the anger that is\naroused in the world by such a claim when it precedes its justification by several\ncenturies, if not several thousand years. Who has the nerve to imagine a period when\nNietzsche will be as far in our past as Plato was from Nietzsche? It suffices for now to\nmake clear that for the next period of time species politics will be decisive. That is,\nwhen it will be learned whether humanity (or at least its culturally decisive faction) will\nbe able to achieve effective means of self-taming. A titanic battle is being waged in our\ncontemporary culture between the civilizing and the bestializing impulses and their\nassociated media. Certainly, any great success in taming would be surprising in the\nface of an unparalleled wave of social developments that seems to be irresistibly\neroding inhibitions.(11) But whether this process will also eventuate in a genetic reform\nof the characteristics of the species; whether the present anthropotechnology portends\nan explicit future determination of traits; whether human beings as a species can\ntransform birth fatalities into optimal births and prenatal selection(12)öthese are\nquestions with which the evolutionary horizon, as always vague and risky, begins to\nglimmer.\nIt is characteristic of being human that human beings are presented with tasks that\nare too difficult for them, without having the option of avoiding them because of their\ndifficulty. This unavoidable provocation of the human by the unattainable left an\nunmistakable trace on the earliest stage of Western philosophy. Perhaps philosophy\nitself, in the widest sense, is that trace. After what has been said it will not be a surprise\nthat this earliest trace took the form of a discourse over shepherding and breeding\nman. In his dialogue Politikos [which we choose to translate as The Statesman (1995)],\nPlato gave us the Magna Charta of European pastoral philosophy. This text is\nsignificant for several reasons. First, it shows more clearly than anywhere else what\nantiquity meant by `thinking' (the achievement of truth through careful division or\nseparation of ideas and things). Its preeminent status in the history of thought about\nhuman beings lies in its simultaneously being presented as a specialists' discussion\namong shepherds, and also as being about the selection of a statesman of a sort not\nfound in Athens, and the creation of citizens of a sort not found in any state. It is no\naccident, perhaps, that the dialogue progresses with the participation of what were\nfor Plato some unusual participantsöa Stranger and the young Socrates, as though\n(11) I refer here to the upsurge of violence that is currently erupting in schools in the entire West,\nparticularly in the USA, where teachers are beginning to construct systems of protection against\nstudents. As in antiquity, the book lost the struggle with the theater, so today the school could lose\nthe struggle with the indirect forces of education, such as television, violent movies, and other\nmedia of disinhibition, if no new acculturation structure for the suppression of violence arises.\n(12) In more general terms, whether they can transform them through the manipulation of biological\nrisk (an enlarged formulation).\n24 P Sloterdijk\nordinary Athenians were not to be allowed to participate in such discussions. So this\nStranger and his interlocutor, Socrates Junior, set themselves the task of imposing\ntransparently rational rules on the politics (or city-shepherding) of their day.\nWith this project, Plato prompted an intellectual discomfort in the human zoo that\ncould never again be completely quieted. Since The Statesman (1995) and The Republic,\nthere have been discourses which speak of human society as if it were a zoo which is at\nthe same time a theme park: the keeping of men in parks or stadiums seems from now\non a zoo-political task. What are presented as reflections on politics are actually\nfoundational reflections on rules for the maintenance of the human zoo. If there is\none virtue of human beings which deserves to be spoken about in a philosophical way,\nit is above all this: that people are not forced into political theme parks but, rather, put\nthemselves there. Humans are self-fencing, self-shepherding creatures. Wherever they\nlive, they create parks around themselves. In city parks, national parks, provincial or\nstate parks, eco-parksöeverywhere people must create for themselves rules according\nto which their comportment is to be governed.\nWhat is required of the Platonic zoo and its newer instantiations above all is to\ndetermine whether there is a difference between the populace and its leadership, and\nwhether that difference is a graduated one or a specific one. According to the first\nassumption, the difference, the distance, between the herders and their charges is only\naccidental and pragmatic. One could accord to such a herd the capacity to choose its\nown shepherds. But, if there is a sharp difference between the people who run the zoo\nand the people who live in it, then they are so basically different that it would not be\nadvisable for them to elect leaders. They should, rather, have governance by insight.\nOnly a deceptive zoo director, a pseudo-statesmen or political sophist, would promote\nhimself as one of the people. The true shepherd acknowledges difference and discretely\nallows it to be known that he, because he leads through insight, stands closer to the\ngods than the confused populace he governs.\nPlato's dangerous sense for dangerous ideas lies within the blind spot of all high-\nculture pedagogues and politicosöin particular, his admission of the actual inequality\nof people before the knowledge that power gives. In the logical form of a grotesque\nsearch for definitions the dialogue develops the preamble of a political anthropotech-\nnology. It is not just a matter of pacifically directing the herd which has already tamed\nitself; it is a question of systematically generating new, idealized, exemplary individuals.\nThe exercise begins so humorously that the not-quite-so-funny ending could easily be\nsubmerged in laughter.What could be more grotesque than the definition of politics as\nthe discipline that concerns itself with the herd animals who travel by foot?öfor\nleaders of men, the gods know, exercise their skill not on animals that swim, but on\nland animals. Among land animals, one must distinguish between herding the feath-\nered and the unfeathered, since man does not have wings and feathers. The Stranger in\nPlato's dialogue adds that even among these there are two clearly distinguishable sorts,\nthe horned and hornless animals. Of course, a knowledgeable interlocutor does not\nneed to hear that twice. The two groups correspond to two arts of shepherding, herding\nthe horned and herding the hornless; and obviously one will find the true shepherd of\nmen only by excluding the shepherds of horned animals. For, if herders of horned\nanimals are allowed to govern men, nothing could be expected but overreactions from\ninappropriate or only apparently appropriate shepherds. The good king, the basileus,\nthe Stranger claims, governs a herd of hornless animals (1995, 265d). And that is not\nall; since, after all, he has the task of herding animals all of one breeding speciesöthat\nis, animals that do not copulate outside of their species, as horses and asses canöthen\nhe must look to their breeding as well, trying to minimize endogamy, bastardization,\nor hybridization. So we list the differentia: wingless, hornless, pairing only with\nRules for the Human Zoo: a response to the Letter on Humanism 25\ntheir likeöand, finally, bipedality, or, as we moderns might say, erect posture. So the\nart of shepherding appropriate to wingless hornless species-specific-breeding bipeds\nis isolated as the true art and distinguished from all false contenders. But this\ncustodial shepherding must itself be bifurcated into the voluntary or the tyrannically\nimposed. Should the tyrannical form in its turn be revealed as a false and deceptive\nillusion, only the true political art remains: the voluntary shepherding of voluntarily\nsubmitting living beings (276e).(13)\nUp to this point Plato has presented his doctrine of the art of statesmanship\nentirely in pictures of shepherds and herds. He has chosen among dozens of misleading\nrepresentations of this art the one true picture, the valid concept of the thing in\nquestion. But now that we have an adequate definition the dialogue switches to\nanother metaphorönot in order to undermine the previous accomplishment, but in\norder to force into the light the most difficult piece of human herding, the management\nof reproduction. The famous image of the statesman as weaver comes into play.\nThe true, the real, basis for the art of the king lies not in the vote of the public, which\ngives or withholds trust from their rulers as it will. Nor does it lie in inherited privilege\nor recent accumulation of power. The Platonic master finds the reason for his mastery\nonly in the expertise he has in the odd and peculiar art of breeding. Here we see the\nreemergence of the expert-king, whose justification is the insight about how, without\ndoing damage to their free will, human beings can best sort themselves out and make\nconnections. Royal anthropotechnology, in short, demands of the statesman that he\nunderstand how to bring together free but suggestible people in order to bring out the\ncharacteristics that are most advantageous to the whole, so that under his direction\nthe human zoo can achieve the optimum homeostasis. This comes about when the two\nrelative optima of human characteröwarlike courage and philosophical ^ humanistic\ncontemplationöare woven together in the tapestry of the species.\nBut because in their extremes both virtues can lead to distortionsöthe one, militaristic\nwarmongering with its bad consequences, the other, quietism and privatization which can\nso stupefy the land that it falls into servitude without ever noticing itöthe statesman has\nto exclude the inappropriate natures before he begins to weave the chosen ones into the\nfabric of the state. Only with the remaining noble and free natures will the good state\nbe created. The courageous provide the heavier fibers, the moderates the softer ones.\nAs Schleiermacher might have put it in somewhat anachronistic terms, the level-headed\nare designated as cultural workers.\n``What we're saying, then, is that the work of a weaver-statesman is complete when\nhe has woven these two types of human characteröthe courageous and the\nrestrainedöinto a tight fabric. It is complete when a king with his knowledge\nmakes sure that consensus and loyalty are the materials out of which he constructs\ntheir communal life, and so creates the most magnificent and excellent fabric there\ncan beöa seamless cloth in which he enfolds all his subjects, whether slave or\nfree ...'' (Plato, 1995, 311b ^ c).\nFor the modern reader, who looks back on the humanistic gymnasia of the bourgeois\nstate and at the fascist eugenics already foreshadowing the biotechnological era, the\nexplosiveness of these considerations is unavoidable. What Plato puts in the mouth of\nthe Stranger is the program of a humanistic society that is embodied in a single full-\nhumanist, the lord of royal shepherding. The task of this u«ber-humanist would be no\nless than arranging that an elite is reared with certain characteristics, each of which\nmust be present for the good of the whole.\n(13) Plato exegetes such as Karl Popper gladly overlook this doubled instance of `voluntarily'.\n26 P Sloterdijk\nThere is a complication. The Platonic shepherd is a true shepherd only because\nhe embodies the earthly copy of the unique and original True Shepherd, God, who in\nthe preexistence, under the lordship of Chronos, protected man directly. One cannot\nforget that, even for Plato, God is the only possible protector and breeder of men.\nNow, though, after the great turnabout, when under the leadership of Zeus the gods\nretreated and handed over to humans the task of governing themselves, the wise have\nbeen left as the only worthy shepherds and breeders, for they have the best recollection\nof the divine shadows. Without the model presented by the wise, the care of man by\nman would be hopeless.\nTwo thousand years after Plato wrote it seems as if not only the gods but the wise\nhave abandoned us, and left us alone with our partial knowledge and our ignorance.\nWhat is left to us in the place of the wise is their writings, in their glinting brilliance\nand their increasing obscurity. They still lay in more or less accessible editions; they can\nstill be read, if only one knew why one should bother. It is their fateöto stand in silent\nbookshelves, like posted letters no longer collected, sent to us by authors, of whom\nwe no longer know whether or not they could be our friends.\nLetters that are not mailed cease to be missives for possible friends; they turn into\narchived things. Thus thisöthat the important books of the past have more and more\nceased to be letters to friends, and that they do not lie any longer on the tables and\nnightstands of their readersöthis has deprived the humanistic movement of its pre-\nvious power. Less and less often do archivists climb up to the ancient texts in order to\nreference earlier statements of modern commonplaces. Perhaps it occasionally happens\nthat in such researches in the dead cellars of culture the long-ignored texts begin to\nglimmer, as if a distant light flickers over them. Can the archives also come into\nthe Clearing? Everything suggests that archivists have become the successors of the\nhumanists. For the few who still peer around in those archives, the realization is\ndawning that our lives are the confused answer to questions which were asked in places\nwe have forgotten.\nReferences\nAllan H, 2001, ``Forward'', in Nicht gerettet:Versuche nach Heidegger (Suhrkamp, Frankfurt)\nde Fontenay E, 1998 Le Silence des Beªtes (Fayard, Paris)\nDufour D R, 1999 Lettres sur la Nature Humaine a© l'Usage des Survivants (Calmann-Le¨vy, Paris)\nEdmundson M, 1997 Nightmare on Mainstreet: Angels, Sadomasochism and the Culture of the\nAmerican Gothic (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA)\nHeidegger M, 1927 Sein und Zeit Jahrbuch fu« r Philosophie und Pha«nomenologische Forschung,\nHalle\nHeideggerM,1977 [1946],``Letter onHumanism'', inMartinHeidegger: BasicWritings Ed.DF Krell,\ntranslated by FA Capuzzi, J G Gray (Harper and Row, New York)\nIdel M, 1990 Golem: Jewish Magical and Mystical Traditions on the Artificial Anthropoid (State\nUniversity of New York Press, Albany, NY)\nMacho,T 1997a, ``Tier,'' inVomMenschen: Handbuch Historische Anthropologie Ed.

  "text": "The Future of Writing\n63\nThis essay will not consider the problems concerning the future of teaching\nthe art of writing in the face of the growing importance of nonliterate\nmessages in our surroundings, although those problems will become\never more important both in the so-called developed countries and in\nsocieties where illiteracy is still widespread. Instead, it proposes to consider\na tendency that underlies those problems: namely, the tendency\naway from linear codes such as writing and toward two-dimensional\ncodes such as photographs, films, and TV, a tendency that may be observed\nif one glances even superficially at the codified world that surrounds\nus. The future of writing, of that gesture which aligns symbols to\nproduce texts, must be seen against the background of that tendency.\nWriting is an important gesture, because it both articulates and produces\nthat state of mind which is called “historical consciousness.” History\nbegan with the invention of writing, not for the banal reason often\nadvanced that written texts permit us to reconstruct the past, but for the\nmore pertinent reason that the world is not perceived as a process, “historically,”\nunless one signifies it by successive symbols, by writing. The\ndifference between prehistory and history is not that we have written\ndocuments that permit us to read the latter, but that during history there\nare literate men who experience, understand, and evaluate the world as a\n“becoming,” whereas in prehistory no such existential attitude is possible.\nIf the art of writing were to fall into oblivion, or if it were to become\nsubservient to picture making (as in the “scriptwriting” in films), history\nin the strict sense of that term would be over.\nIf one examines certain Mesopotamian tiles, one can see that the\noriginal purpose of writing was to facilitate the deciphering of images.\nThose tiles contain images impressed upon them with cylindrical seals\nand “cuneiform” symbols scratched into them with a stylus. The “cuneiform”\nsymbols form lines, and they obviously mean the image they accompany.\nThey “explain,” “recount,” “tell” it. They do so by unrolling the\nsurface of the image into lines, by unwinding the tissue of the image into\nthe threads of a text, by rendering “explicit” what was “implicit” within\nthe image. It may be shown through text analysis that the original purpose\nof writing, namely, the transcoding of two-dimensional codes into a\nsingle dimension, is still there: every text, even a very abstract one, means,\nin the last analysis, an image.\nThe translation from surface into line implies a radical change of\nmeaning. The eye that deciphers an image scans the surface, and it thus\nestablishes reversible relations between the elements of the image. It may\ngo back and forth while deciphering the image. This reversibility of relations\nthat prevails within the image characterizes the world for those who\nuse images for the understanding of the world, who “imagine” it. For\nthem, all the things in the world are related to each other in such a reversible\nway, and their world is structured by “eternal return.” It is just as\ntrue to say that night follows day as that day follows night, that sowing\nfollows reaping as that reaping follows sowing, that life follows death as\nthat death follows life. The crowing of the cock calls the sun to rise just as\nmuch as the rising sun calls the cock to crow. In such a world, circular\ntime orders all things, “assigns them their just place,” and if a thing is displaced\nit will be readjusted by time itself. Because to live is to displace\nthings, life in such a world is a series of “unjust” acts that will be revenged\nin time. This demands that man propitiate the order of the world, the\n“gods” of which it is full. In sum: the “imagined” world is the world of\nmyth, of magic, the prehistorical world.\nThe eye that deciphers a text follows its lines, and thus establishes the\nunivocal relation of a chain between the elements of which the text is\ncomposed. Those who use texts to understand the world, those who\n“conceive” it, mean a world with a linear structure. Everything in such a\nworld follows from something, time flows irreversibly from the past toward\nthe future, each instant lost is lost forever, and there is no repetition.\nEach day is different from every other day, each sowing has its own\ncharacteristics, if there is life after death it must be a new sort of life, and\nthe links of the causal chain cannot be exchanged one for the other. In\nsuch a world, every human act is unique, and man is responsible for it.\nThe elements of such a world are, at least theoretically, distinct from each\n64 The Future of Writing\nother like the beads on a string, and they can be counted. On the other\nhand, the string that orders the beads, the “univocal flow of time,” is what\nholds such a world together. In sum: the “conceived” world is the world\nof the religions, of salvation, of political commitment, of science, and of\ntechnology—the historical world.\nOne may well ask why, six thousand years ago, the effort was made to\nsubstitute the world of conception for the world of imagination, why\nwriting was invented. One may ask this at present precisely because a\n“new civilization of images” seems to be dawning. The answer is, of\ncourse: because, six thousand years ago, some people thought that some\nimages needed explaining. Images are mediations between man and his\nworld, a world that has become inaccessible to him immediately. They\nare tools to overcome human alienation: they are meant to permit action\nin a world in which man no longer lives immediately but that he faces.\nCave paintings are meant to permit hunting of ponies, cathedral windows\nto permit praying to God, road maps to permit motoring, and statistical\nprojections to permit decision making. One must learn how to\ndecipher those images, one must learn the conventions that give them\ntheir meaning, and one may commit mistakes. For instance: it would be\na mistake to decipher road maps as if they were cave paintings (magic\nfor hunting tourists), or as if they were projections (proposals to build\nroads). The “imagination” that produces road maps is not the same as the\n“imagination” that produces cave paintings and projections. Explaining\nimages with the help of texts may therefore be useful.\nBut there is yet another, and more profound, reason for the invention\nof writing and of historical consciousness. There is in images, as in all\nmediations, a curious inherent dialectic. The purpose of images is to\nmean the world, but they may become opaque to the world and cover it,\neven substitute for it. They may come to constitute an imaginary world\nthat no longer mediates between man and the world, but, on the contrary,\nimprisons man. Imagination no longer overcomes alienation, but\nbecomes hallucination, or double alienation. No longer are such images\ntools, but man himself becomes a tool of his own tools; he “adores” the\nimages he himself has produced. It is against this idolatry of images, as a\ntherapy against this double alienation, that writing was invented. The\nearly writers in our tradition—the prophets, for instance—knew this by\ncommitting themselves against idols and idol making. And so did Plato\nwhen he announced his hatred of what we now call the “plastic arts.”\nWriting, historical consciousness, linear, rational thought were invented\nto save humankind from “ideologies,” from hallucinatory imagination.\nThe Future of Writing 65\nNow, if we consider history to be the period of writing, which implies\nthat history is a development of prehistory, a rendering explicit of what\nwas implicit in prehistorical myths, we find that it is a slow and painful,\nnot to say tragic, process. For most of its course, historical consciousness\nwas the privilege of a small elite, while the vast majority continued to lead\na prehistoric, magico-mythical existence. This was so because texts were\nrare and expensive, and literacy the privilege of a class of scribes and\nliterati. The invention of printing cracked this clerical class open, and it\nmade historical consciousness accessible for the rising bourgeoisie, but it\nwas only during the industrial revolution and through the public primary\nschool system that literacy and historical consciousness can be said to have\nbecome common in the industrialized countries. But almost immediately\na new kind of image, the photograph, was invented, which began to threaten\nthe supremacy of writing, and it now looks as if the days of historical,\nrational, conceptual thinking were numbered, and as if we were approaching\na new type of magico-mythical age, a posthistorical image culture.\nThe reason why rational, conceptual thinking (and acting) is an exceptional\nform of existence, why history seems to be a brief interlude\nwithin the ageless “eternal return” of myth and magic, is that writing, just\nlike images, is torn by an internal dialectic, and that this dialectic takes a\nmore pernicious aspect in writing than it does even in image making.\nThe purpose of writing is to mean, to explain images, but texts may become\nopaque, unimaginable, and they then constitute barriers between\nman and the world. The vectors of meaning of such texts turn around\nand point at their authors, instead of pointing at the world. This inversion\nof writing may be observed very early in the course of history, but\nduring the nineteenth century it becomes obvious: scientific texts (which\nare the most characteristic form of writing, and therefore the “aim of history”)\ntend to become explicitly unimaginable (one reads them erroneously\nif one tries to imagine their meaning), and scientific research\n“discovers” the rules that order its own texts (mainly logic and mathematics)\n“behind” the phenomena it is explaining. Such unimaginable explanations\nthat mirror the structure of literate thought are existentially\ndevoid of meaning, and in such a situation texts begin to constitute a\nkind of paranoid library wall that triply alienates man from his world. It\nis against the threatening lunacy of formal rationalism, of a meaningless\nexistence amid speculative, opaque explanations, that the rise of the new\nimage culture must be seen.\nHowever, it would be an error to suppose that life amid posters, traffic\nsigns, TV programs, illustrated magazines, and movie pictures will be\n66 The Future of Writing\nlike life before the invention of writing, that illiteracy will be restored.\nThe new type of images are unlike their prehistoric predecessors in that\nthey are themselves products of texts, and in that they feed on texts. They\nare products of history. The essential difference between a TV program\nand a tapestry is not (as one might believe) that the one moves and talks\nwhile the other stands still and is mute, but that the TV program is the\nresult of scientific theories (texts) and that it needs texts (for instance,\ntelegrams) for it to function. The new types of images are best called\n“techno-images,” and the convention they are based on is best called\n“techno-imagination,” if one is to distinguish the world of the future\nfrom prehistoric existence. No doubt techno-images are a sort of image,\nand they therefore mean, like every image, a world of myth and of magic.\nBut life in the threatening future will be mythical, magic, in a sense quite\ndifferent from prehistoric myth and magic. This difference may be stated\nas follows: prehistoric images mean the world, posthistoric ones mean\ntexts; prehistoric imagination tries to seize the world and posthistoric\nimagination tries to be text illustration. Therefore, prehistoric myths\nmean “real” situations and posthistoric myths will mean textual prescriptions,\nand prehistoric magic is meant to propitiate the world, whereas\nposthistoric magic will be meant to manipulate people.\nThe easiest way to imagine the future of writing, if the present trend\ntoward a culture of techno-images goes on, is to imagine culture as a\ngigantic transcoder from text into image. It will be a sort of black box\nthat has texts for input and images for output. All texts will flow into that\nbox (news about events, theoretical comments about them, scientific papers,\npoetry, philosophical speculations), and they will come out again as\nimages (films, TV programs, photographic pictures): which is to say that\nhistory will flow into the box, and that it will come out of it under the\nform of myth and magic. From the point of view of the texts that will\nflow into the box, this will be a utopian situation: the box is the “fullness\nof time,” because it devours linear time and freezes it into images. From\nthe point of view of the images that come out of the box, this will be a\nsituation in which history becomes a pretext for programs. In sum, the\nfuture of writing is to write pretexts for programs while believing that\none is writing for utopia.\nIt is not important for the understanding of such a future of writing\nto try to whiten the black box, to try to understand how it works. The attempt\nto “demythify” the transcoding apparatus of the future is, of\ncourse, one of the most important challenges of “forecasting and planning\nfor the future.” But it is not indispensable where writing is the\nThe Future of Writing 67\nproblem. One may disregard the wheels and screws that constitute the\napparatus (the countless “media,” “programmers,” and other human and\nquasi-human operators who compose it), and concentrate upon the images\nas they come out of the box left black, if one wants to see what it\nwill mean to be a “writer” in such a future. In other words, it is not necessary\nto analyze the whole hopelessly complex system that stands behind\na TV program if one wants to understand the present crisis of rational\nthinking and acting. It is sufficient to analyze that program.\nIf one does so, one discovers the root of the present crisis: it is an inversion\nof the historical roles of reason and imagination.History may be said\nto be the attempt to submit imagination to the criticism of reason. Texts\nare meant to be critiques of images, and writing, as a code, is an analysis of\nsurfaces into lines. Therefore, during history, imagination was the source\nof reason: the stronger the imagination, the greater the challenge of critical\nreason, and rich images permit more powerful linear explanations.\nThere is something iconoclastic about historical reason: the better the\nicons against which it advances, the stronger is reason. But now writing is\nbecoming subservient to image making, reason to imagination: one can\nobserve this while analyzing any TV program. The better the reasoning,\nthe richer becomes imagination. Planning has become a highly rational\nprocess in the service of highly irrational aims. The crisis is therefore not\none of oblivion of the art of writing, of reason’s decadence. It is one of\nreason’s prostitution, of a “betrayal of the intellectuals.”One may sum this\nup as follows: when it became obvious that reason might be a kind of\nparanoia, the intellectuals stopped being iconoclastic and became idolatrous,\nand present TV programs are among the results of that conversion.\nTV programs are not, of course, the most impressive examples of\nwhat happens when reason betrays itself and serves imagination. Nazism\nis a better illustration. Still, it may be held that Nazism is one of the cruder\nadvances in the direction of a future culture of images, or that the future\ntechno-image culture will be Nazism perfected. This is why the battle cry\n“L’imagination au pouvoir!” that shook so many intellectuals out of their\ndogmatic slumber in May ’68 has such a dubious ring to it.No doubt, rebellion\nagainst paranoid reason, against meaningless explanations, is\nnecessary and healthy. But intellectuals are writers. They are committed\nto clear and distinct concepts, to reason. They are the historical consciousness\nof their society. If they adhere to the claim that imagination\nshould take over, the dignity of man as a free actor, which means “history,”\nwill be over.\nIt may be asked, however, what else writers can do in the immediate\n68 The Future of Writing\nfuture but serve imagination. If all the texts are going to be devoured by\nthe gigantic transcoder to become images, how can this trend be resisted?\nIs it not so that if a text deliberately resists the trend, it becomes even better\nfodder for the transcoding apparatus? Actions committed to history\nand against the apparatus, like monks burning themselves to death or\nstudents being killed in riots, are even better pretexts for TV programs\nthan are deliberate scripts made by TV programmers. It may look as if\nthe trend, in which writing is becoming subservient to image making,\nplanning to irrationality, and reason to magic, is increasingly automatic\nand autonomous of individual decisions.\nThis would be a perniciously wrong interpretation of the present crisis\nof writing. The purpose of writing is to explain images, and the task of\nreason is to criticize imagination. This is doubly true in the present crisis.\nAt present, the purpose of writing is to explain techno-images, and the\ntask of reason to criticize techno-imagination. Of course, this implies a\nsort of qualitative jump onto a new level of meaning on the part of reason.\nIn the past, writing explained images of the world. It will have to explain\nillustrations of texts in the future. To write meant, in the past, to\nrender opaque images transparent for the world. It will mean, in the future,\nto render opaque techno-images transparent for the texts they are\nhiding. In other words, reason, in the past, meant analysis of myths, and\nin the future it will mean de-ideologization. Reason will still be iconoclastic,\nbut on a new level.\nNothing guarantees that reason will be able to perform such a jump,\nalthough there are some symptoms (for instance, cybernetics and structural\nanalysis) that point in such a direction. It is perfectly possible that\nthe general trend toward techno-images will become irresistible, and that\nreason will degenerate into the planning of programs—that to write will\nmean not to make “grams” but “programs,” and that all texts will become\npretexts. Thus, in fact, we may discern, at present, two possible futures\nof writing: it will either become a critique of techno-imagination (which\nmeans an unmasking of the ideologies hiding behind a technical progress\nthat has become autonomous of human decisions) or it will become the\nproduction of pretexts for techno-imagination (a planning for that technical\nprogress). In the first alternative, the future will be unimaginable by\ndefinition. In the second, history in the strict sense of that term will come\nto an end, and we may easily imagine what will follow: the eternal return\nof life in an apparatus that progresses by its own inertia.\n(1983–84)\nThe Future of Writing 69",

  "text": "In metaphysics reflection is accomplished concerning the essence\nof what is and a decision takes place regarding the essence of\ntruth.' Metaphysics grounds an age, in that through a specific\ninterpretation of what is and through a specific comprehension\nof truth it gives to that age the basis upon which it is essentially\nformed? This basis holds complete dominion over all the phenomena\nthat distinguish the age. Conversely, in order that there\nmay be an adequate reflection upon these phenomena themselves,\nthe metaphysical basis for them must let itself be apprehended\n1. \"Reflection\" translates Besinnung, On the meaning of the latter, see\nSR 155 n. 1. \"'Essence\" will be the translation of the noun Wesen in most\ninstances of its occurrence in this essay. Occasionally the translation\n\"coming to presence\" will be used. Wesen must always be understood to\nallude .. for Heidegger, not to any mere \"whatness,\" but to the manner in\nwhich anything, as what it is, takes its COurse and \"holds sway\" it. its\nongoing presence, i.e., the manner in which it endures in its presencing.\nSee QT 30, 3 n. 1. \"What is\" renders the present participle seiend used\nas a noun, das Seiende. On the translation of the latter, see T 40 n. 6.\n2. der Grund seines Wesensgestalt. Heidegger exemplifies the statement\nthat he makes here in his discussion of the metaphysics of Descartes as\nproviding the necessary interpretive ground for the manner in which, in\nthe subjectness of man as self-conscious subject, Being and all that is and\nman-in their immediate and indissoluble relation-come to presence in the\nmodern age. See Appendix 9, pp. 150 ft.\n,\n\"in them. Reflection is the courage to make the truth of our own\npresuppositions and the realm of our own goals into the things\nthat most deserve to be called in question (see Appendix 1).3\nOne of the essential phenomena of the modern age is its science.\nA phenomenon of no less importance is machine technology.\nWe must not, however, misinterpret that technology as\nthe mere application of modern mathematical physical science\nto praxis. Machine technology is itself an autonomous transformation\nof praxis, a type of transformation wherein praxis\nfirst demands the employment of mathematical physical science.\nMachine technology remains up to noW the most visible outgrowth\nof the essence of modern technology, which is identical\nwith the essence of modern metaphysics.\nA third equally essential phenomenon of the modern period\nlies in the event of art's moving into the purview of aesthetics.\nThat means that the art work becomes the object of mere subjective\nexperience, and that consequently art is considered to be\nan expression of human life. 4\nA fourth modern phenomenon manifests itself in the fact that\nhuman activity is conceived and consummated as culture. Thus\nculture is the realization of the highest values, through the nurture\nand cultivation of the highest goods of man. It lies in the\nessence of culture, as such nurturing, to nurture itself in its turn\nand thus to become the politics of culture.\nA fifth phenomenon of the modern age is the loss of the gods.5\nThis expression does not mean the mere doing away with the\ngods, gross atheism. The loss of the gods is a twofold process.\nOn the one hand, the world picture is Christianized inasmuch\nas the cause of the world is posited as infinite, unconditional,\n3. Heidegger's explanatory appendixes begin on p. 137.\n4. ErlebTlis, translated here as \"subjective experience\" and later as \"lifeexperience,\"\nis a term much used by life philosophers such as Dilthey and\ngenerally connotes adventure and event. It is employed somewhat pejoratively\nhere. The term ErfahrUTlg, which is regularly translated in this volume\nas \"experience,\" connotes discovery and learning, and also suffering and\nundergoing. Here and subsequently (i.e\" \"mere religiOUS experience\"),\n\"mere\" is inserted to maintain the distinction between Erlebnis and\nErfahruTlg.\n5. EntgBtterung, here inadequately rendered as \"loss of the gods,\" actually\nmeans something more like \"degodization.\"\nThe Age of the World Picture 117\nabsolute. On the other hand, Christendom transforms Christian\ndoctrine into a world view (the Christian world view), and in\nthat way makes itself modern and up to date. The 1055 of the\ngods is the situation of indecision regarding God and the gods.\nChristendom has the greatest share in bringing it about. But the\nloss of the gods is so far from excluding religiosity that rather\nonly through that loss is the relation to the gods changed into\nmere \"religiOUS experience.\" When this occurs, then the gods\nhave fled. The resultant void is compensated for by means of\nhistoriographical and psychological investigation of myth.\nWhat understanding of what is, what interpretation of truth,\nlies at the foundation of these phenomena?\nWe shall limit the question to the phenomenon mentioned\nfirst, to science [Wissenschaft].\nIn what does the essence of modern science lie?\nWhat understanding of what is and of truth provides the basis\nfor that essence? If we succeed in reaching the metaphysical\nground that provides the foundation for science as a modern\nphenomenon, then the entire essence of the modem age will have\nto let itself be apprehended from out of that ground.\nWhen we use the word \"science\" today, it means something\nessentially different from the doctrina and scientia of the Middle\nAges, and also from the Greek episteme. Greek science was\nnever exact, precisely because, in keeping with its essence, it\ncould not be exact and did not need to be exact. Hence it makes\nno sense whatever to suppose that modern science is more exact\nthan that of antiquity. Neither can we say that the Galilean\ndoctrine of freely falling bodies is true and that Aristotle's\nteaching, that light bodies strive upward, is false; for the Greek\nunderstanding of the essence of body and place and of the relation\nbetween the two rests upon a different interpretation of\nbeings and hence conditions a correspondingly different kind\nof seeing and questioning of natural events. No one would presume\nto maintain that Shakespeare's poetry is more advanced\nthan that of Aeschylus. It is still more impossible to say that\nthe modern understanding of whatever is, is more correct than\nthat of the Greeks. Therefore, if we want to grasp the essence of\nmodern science, we must first free ourselves from the habit ofcomparing the new science with the old solely in terms of degree,\nfrom the point of view of progress.\nThe essence of what we today call science is research. In what\ndoes the essence of research consist?\nIn the fact that knowing [das Erkennel1] establishes itself as\na procedure within some realm of what is, in nature or in history.\nProcedure does not mean here merely method or methodology.\nFor every procedure already requires an open sphere in which\nit moves. And it is precisely the opening up of such a sphere that\nis the fundamental event in research. This is accomplished\nthrough the projection within some realm of what is-in nature,\nfor example-of a fixed ground planS of natural events. The\nprojection sketches out in advance the manner in which the\nknowing procedure must bind itself and adhere to the sphere\nopened up. This binding adherence is the rigor of research.'\nThrough the projecting of the ground plan and the prescribing of\nrigor, procedure makes secure for itself its sphere of objects\nwithin the realm of Being. A look at that earliest science, which\nis at the same time the normative one in the modern age, namely,\nmathematical physics, will make clear what we mean. Inasmuch\nas modern atomic physics still remains physics, what is essential\n-and only the essential is aimed at here-will hold for it also.\nModern physics is called mathematical because, in a remarkable\nway, it makes use of a quite specific mathematics. But it\ncan proceed mathematically in this way only because, in a deeper\nsense, it is already itself mathematical. T a mathemata means for\nthe Greeks that which man knows in advance in his observation\nof whatever is and in his intercourse with things: the corporeality\nof bodies, the vegetable character of plants, the animality\nof animals, the humanness of man. Alongside these, belonging\nalso to that which is already-known, i.e., to the mathematical,\nare numbers. If we come upon three apples on the table, we\n6. Grlmdris •. The verb reissen means to tear, to rend, to sketch, to design,\nand the noun Ris. means tear. gap, outline. Hence the nOun Grurtdris5, first\nsketch, ground plan, design, connotes a fundamental sketching out that is\nan opening up as well.\n7. \"Binding adherence\" here translates the noun Findung. The noun could\nalso be rendered \"obligation.\" It could thus be said that rigor is the obligation\nto remain within the realm opened up.\nThe Age of the World Picture 119\nrecognize that there are three of them. But the number three,\nthreeness, we already know. This means that number is something\nmathematical. Only because numbers represent, as it were,\nthe most striking of always-already-knowns, and thus offer the\nmost familiar instance of the mathematical, is \"mathematical\"\npromptly reserved as a name for the numerical. In no way, however,\nis the essence of the mathematical defined by numberness.\nPhysics is, in general, the knowledge of nature, and, in particular,\nthe knowledge of material corporeality in its motion; for\nthat corporeality manifests itself immediately and universally in\neverything natural, even if in a variety of ways. If physics takes\nshape explicitly, then, as something mathematical, this means\nthat, in an especially pronounced way, through it and for it\nsomething is stipulated in advance as what is already-known.\nThat stipulating has to do with nothing less than the plan or\nprojection of that which must henceforth, for the knowing of\nnature that is sought after, be nature: the self-contained system\nof motion of units of mass related spatiotemporally. Into this\nground plan of nature, as supplied in keeping with its prior\nstipulation, the follOWing definitions among others have been\nincorporated: Motion means change of place. No motion or\ndirection of motion is superior to any other. Every place is equal\nto every other. No point in time has preference over any other.\nEvery force is defined according to-i.e., is only-its consequences\nin motion, and that means in magnitude of change of\nplace in the unity of time. Every event must be seen so as to be\nfitted into this ground plan of nature. Only within the perspective\nof this ground plan does an event in nature become visible\nas such an event. This projected plan of nature finds its guarantee\nin the fact that physical research, in everyone of its\nquestioning steps, is bound in advance to adhere to it. This\nbinding adherence, the rigor of research, has its own character\nat any given time in keeping with the projected plan. The rigor\nof mathematical physical science is exactitude. Here all events,\nif they are to enter at all into representation as events of nature,\nmust be defined beforehand as spatiotemporal magnitudes of\nmotion. Such defining is accomplished through measuring, with\nthe help of number and calculation. But mathematical researchinto nature is not exact because it calculates with preCISIOn;\nrather it must calculate in this way because its adherence to its\nobject-sphere has the character of exactitude. The humanistic\nsciences, in contrast, indeed all the sciences concerned with life,\nmust necessarily be inexact just in order to remain rigorous.\nA living thing can indeed also be grasped as a spatiotemporal\nmagnitude of motion, but then it is no longer apprehended as\nliving. The inexactitude of the historical humanistic sciences is\nnot a deficiency, but is only the fulfillment of a demand essential\nto this type of research. It is true, also, that the projecting and\nsecuring of the object-sphere of the historical sciences is not\nonly of another kind, but is much more difficult of execution\nthan is the achieving of rigor in the exact sciences.\nScience becomes research through the projected plan and\nthrough the securing of that plan in the rigor of procedure. Projection\nand rigor, however, first develop into what they are in\nmethodology. The latter constitutes the second essential characteristic\nof research. If the sphere that is projected is to become\nobjective, then it is a matter of bringing it to encounter us in\nthe complete diversity of its levels and interweavings. Therefore\nprocedure must be free to view the changeableness in whatever\nencounters it. Only within the horizon of the incessant-otherness\nof change does the plenitude of particularity-of facts-show\nitself. But the facts must become objective [gegenstandlichJ.\nHence procedure must represent [varstellen] the changeable in\nits changing,\" must bring it to a stand and let the motion be a\nmotion nevertheless. The fixedness of facts and the cOnstantness\nof their change as such is \"rule.\" The constancy of change in\nthe necessity of its course is \"law.\" It is only within the purview\nof rule and law that facts become clear as the facts that they\nare. Research into facts in the realm of nature is intrinsically\nthe establishing and verifying of rule and law. Methodology,\nthrough which a sphere of objects comes into representation,\n8. Throughout this essay the literal meaning of vorstelJen, which is\nusually translated with \"to represent,\" is constantly in the foreground, so\nthat the verb suggests specifically a seUing-in-place-before that is an objectifying,\ni.e., a bringing to a stand as object. See pp. 127, 129-30, 132; d.\nAppendix 9, pp. 148 ff. Heidegger frequently hyphenates 7Jorstellen in this\nessay and its appendixes so as to stress the meaning that he intends.\nThe Age of the World Picture 121\nhas the character of clarifying on the basis of what is clear-of\nexplanation. Explanation is always twofold. It accounts for an\nunknown by means of a known, and at the same time it verifies\nthat known by means of that unknown. Explanation takes place\nin investigation. In the physical sciences investigation takes\nplace by means of experiment, always according to the kind of\nfield of investigation and according to the type of explanation\naimed at. But physical science does not first become research\nthrough experiment; rather, on the contrary, experiment first\nbecomes possible wh.:!re and only where the knowledge of nature\nhas been transformed into research. Only because modern physics\nis a physics that is essentially mathematical can it be experimental.\nBecause neither medieval doctrina nor Greek episteme\nis science in the sense of research, for these it is never a question\nof experiment. To be sure, it was Aristotle who first understood\nwhat empeiria (expelientia) means: the observation of things\nthemselves, their qualities and modifications under changing\nconditions, and consequently the knowledge of the way in which\nthings as a rule behave. But an observation that aims at such\nknowledge, the experimentum, remains essentially different from\nthe observation that belongs to science as research, from the\nresearch experiment; it remains essentially different even when\nancient and medieval observation also works with number and\nmeasure, and even when that observation makes use of specific\napparatus and instruments. For in all this, that which is decisive\nabout the experiment is completely missing. Experiment begins\nwith the laying down of a law as a basis. To set up an experiment\nmeans to represent or conceive [vorsfellen] the conditions under\nwhich a specific series of motions can be made susceptible of\nbeing followed in its necessary progression, i.e., of being controlled\nin advance by calculation. But the establishing of a law\nis accomplished with reference to the ground plan of the objectsphere.\nThat ground plan furnishes a criterion and constrains\nthe anticipatory representing of the conditions. Such representing\nin and through which the experiment begins is no random\nimagining. That is why Newton said, hypothesis non fingo, \"the\nbases that are laid down are not arbitrarily invented.\" They are\ndeveloped out of the ground plan of nature and are sketched\ninto it. Experiment is that methodology which, in its planning and execution, is supported and guided on the basis of the\nfundamental law laid down, in order to adduce the facts that\neither verify and confirm the law or deny it confirmation. The\nmore exactly the ground plan of nature is projected, the more\nexact becomes the possibility of experiment. Hence the muchcited\nmedieval Schoolman Roger Bacon can never be the forerunner\nof the modern experimental research scientist; rather he\nremains merely a successor of Aristotle. For in the meantime,\nthe real locus of truth has been transferred by Christendom to\nfaith-to the infallibility of the written word and to the doctrine\nof the Church. The highest knowledge and teaching is theology\nas the interpretation of the divine word of revelation, which is\nset down in Scripture and proclaimed by the Church. Here, to\nknow is not to search out; rather it is to understand rightly the\nauthoritative Word and the authorities proclaiming it. Therefore,\nthe discussion of the words and doctrinal opinions of the\nvarious authorities takes precedence in the acquiring of knowledge\nin the Middle Ages. The componere scripta et sermones, the\nargumentum ex verbo,9 is decisive and at the same time is the\nreason why the accepted Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy\nthat had been taken over had to be transformed into scholastic\ndialectic. If, now, Roger Bacon demands the experimentum-and\nhe does demand it-he does not mean the experiment of science\nas research; rather he wants the argumentum ex re instead of the\nargumentum ex verbo, the careful obserVing of things themselves,\ni.e., Aristotelian empeiria, instead of the discussion of doctrines.\nThe modem research experiment, however, is not only an\nobservation more precise in degree and scope, but is a methodology\nessentially different in kind, related to the verification of\nlaw in the framework, and at the service, of an exact plan of\nnature. Source criticism in the historical humanistic sciences corresponds\nto experiment in physical research. Here the name\n\"source criticism\" designates the whole gamut of the discovery,\nexamination, verification, evaluation, preservation, and interpretation\nof sources. Historiographical explanation, which is\n9. \"The comparing of the writings with the sayings, the argument from\nthe word.\" Argume>1tum ex re, which follows shortly, means \"argument\nfrom the thing.\"\nThe Age of the World Picture 123\nbased on source criticism, does not, it is true, trace facts back\nto laws and rules. But neither does it confine itself to the mere\nreporting of facts. In the historical sciences, just as in the natural\nsciences, the methodology aims at representing what is fixed\nand stable and at making history an object. History can become\nobjective only when it is past. What is stable in what is past,\nthat on the basis of which historiographical explanation reckons\nup the solitary and the diverse in history, is the always-hasbeen-\nonce-already, the comparable. Through the constant comparing\nof everything with everything, what is intelligible is\nfound by calculation and is certified and established as the\nground plan of history. The sphere of historiographical research\nextends only so far as historiographical explanation reaches. The\nunique, the rare, the simple--in short, the great-in history is\nnever self-evident and hence remains inexplicable. It is not that\nhistorical research denies what is great in history; rather it\nexplains it as the exception. In this explaining, the great is measured\nagainst the ordinary and the average. And there is no other\nhistoriographical explanation so long as explaining means reduction\nto what is intelligible and so long as historiography remains\nresearch, Le., an explaining. Because historiography as research\nprojects and objectifies the past in the sense of an explicable and\nsurveyable nexus of actions and consequences, it requires source\ncriticism as its instrument of objectification. The standards of\nthis criticism alter to the degree that historiography approaches\njournalism.\nEvery science is, as research, grounded upon the projection\nof a circumscribed object-sphere and is therefore necessarily\na science of individualized character. Every individualized science\nmust, moreover, in the development of its projected plan by\nmeans of its methodology, particularize itself into specifk fields\nof investigation. This particularizing (specialization) is, however,\nby no means simply an irksome concomitant of the increasing\nunsurveyability of the results of research. It is not a necessary\nevil, but is rather an essential necessity of science as\nresearch. Specialization is not the consequence but the foundation\nof the progress of all research. Research does not, through\nits methodology, become dispersed into random investigations, so as to lose itself in them; for modern science is determined by\na third fundamental event: ongoing activity (Appendix 2).10\nBy this is to be understood first of all the phenomenon that a\nscience today, whether physical or humanistic, attains to the\nrespect due a science only when it has become capable of being\ninstitutionalized. However, research is not ongoing activity be-cause\nits work is accomplished in institutions, but rather institutions\nare necessary because science, intrinsically as research,\nhas the character of ongoing activity. The methodology through\nwhich individual object-spheres are conquered does not simply\namass results. Rather, with the help of its results it adapts\n[richter sich ... einJ itself for a new procedure. Within the complex\nof machinery that is necessary to physics in order to carry\nout the smashing of the atom lies hidden the whole of physics\nup to now. Correspondingly, in historiographical research, funds\nof source materials become usable for explanation only if those\nsources are themselves guaranteed on the basis of historiographical\nexplanation. In the course of these processes, the\nmethodology of the science becomes circumscribed by means\nof its results. More and more the methodology adapts itself to\nthe possibilities of procedure opened up through itself. This\nhaving-to-adapt-itself to its own results as the ways and means\nof an advancing methodology is the essence of research's character\nas ongoing activity. And it is that character that is the\nintrinsic basis for the necessity of the institutional nature of\nresearch.\nIn ongoing activity the plan of an object-sphere is, for the\nfirst time, built into whatever is. All adjustments that facilitate\na plannable conjoining of types of methodology, that further the\nreciprocal checking and communication of results, and that regulate\nthe exchange of talents are measures that are by no means\nonly the external consequences of the fact that research work\nis expanding and proliferating. Rather, research work becomes\nthe distant sign, still far from being understood, that modern\nscience is beginning to enter upon the decisive phase of its his-\n10. \"Ongoing activity\" is the rendering of Betrieb, which is difficult to\ntranslate adequately. It means the act of driving on, or industry, activity,\nas well as undertaking, pursuit, business. It can also mean management, or\nworkshop or factory.\nThe Age of the World Picture 125\ntory. Only now is it beginning to take possession of its own\ncomplete essence.\nWhat is taking place in this extending and consolidating of\nthe institutional character of the sciences? Nothing less than the\nmaking secure of the precedence of methodology over whatever\nis (nature and history), which at any given time becomes objective\nin research. On the foundation of their character as ongoing\nactivity, the sciences are creating for themselves the solidarity\nand unity appropriate to them. Therefore historiographical or\narcheological research that is carried forward in an institutionalized\nway is essentially closer to research in physics that is\nsimilarly organized than it is to a discipline belonging to its\nown facultv in the humanistic sciences that still remains mired\nin mere er~dition. Hence the decisive development of the modern\ncharacter of science as ongoing activity also forms men of a\ndifferent stamp. The scholar disappears. He is succeeded by the\nresearch man who is engaged in research projects. These, rather\nthan the cultivating of erudition, lend to his work its atmosphere\nof incisiveness. The research man no longer needs a library at\nhome. Moreover, he is constantly on the move. He negotiates\nat meetings and collects information at congresses. He contracts\nfor commissions with publishers, The latter now determine along\nwith him which books must be written (Appendix 3).\nThe research worker necessarily presses forward of himself\ninto the sphere characteristic of the technologist in the essential\nsense. Only in this way is he capable of acting effectively, and\nonly thus, after the manner of his age, is he real. Alongside him,\nthe increasingly thin and empty Romanticism of scholarship\nand the university will still be able to persist for some time in\na few places. However, the effective unity characteristic of the\nuniversity, and hence the latter's reality, does not lie in some\nintellectual power belonging to an original unification of the\nsciences and emanating from the university because nourished\nby it and preserved in it. The university is real as an orderly\nestablishment that, in a form still unique because it is administratively\nself-contained, makes possible and visible the striving\napart of the sciences into the particularization and peculiar unity\nthat belong to ongoing activity. Because the forces intrinsic to\nthe essence of modern science come immediately and unequiv ocally to effective working in ongoing activity, therefore also\nit is only the spontaneous ongoing activities of research tha;\ncan sketch out and establish the internal unity with other like\nactivities that is commensurate with themselves.\nThe real system of science consists in a solidarity of procedure\nand attitude with respect to the objectification of whatever i5-\na solidarity that is brought about appropriately at any given time\n~n the basis of planning. The excellence demanded of this system\nIS ~ot some contriv~d and rigid unity of the relationships among\nobject-spheres, haVIng to do with content, but is rather the\ngreatest possible free, though regulated, flexibility in the shifting\nabout and introducing of research apropos of the leading tasks\nat any given time. The more exclusively science individualizes\nitself with a view to the total carrying on and mastering of its\nwork process, and the more realistically these ongoing activities\nare shifted into separate research institutes and professional\nschools, the more irreSistibly do the sciences achieve the consummation\nof their modern essence. But the more unconditionally\nscience and the man of research take seriously the modern\nform of their essence, the more unequivocally and the mOre\nimmediately will they be able to offer themselves for the common\ngood, and the more unreservedly too will they have to return\nto the public anonymity of all work useful to society.\nModern science simultaneously establishes itself and differentiates\nitself in its projections of specific object-spheres. These\nprojection-plans are developed by means of a corresponding\nmethodology, which is made secure through rigor. Methodology\nadapts and establishes itself at any given time in ongoing activity.\nProjectio~. and rigor, methodology and ongoing activity,\nmutuaUy requmng one another, constitute the essence of modern\nscience, transform science into research.\nWe are reflecting on the essence of modern science in order\nthat we may apprehend in it its metaphysical ground. What\nun~erstanding of what is and what concept of truth prOVide the\nbaSIS for the fact that science is being transformed into research?\nKnOWing, as research, calls whatever is to account with regard\nto the w~y in which and the extent to which it lets itself be put\nat the dIsposal of representation. Research has disposal over\nThe Age of the World Picture 127\nanything that is when it can either calculate it in its future\ncourse in advance or verify a calculation about it as past. Nature,\nin being calculated in advance, and history, in being historiographically\nverified as past, become, as it were, \"set in place\"\n[ge5tel1tJ.ll Nature and history become the objects of a representing\nthat explains. Such representing counts on nature and\ntakes account of history. Only that which becomes object in this\nway is-is considered to be in being. We first arrive at science as\nresearch when the Being of whatever is, is sought in such objectiveness.\nThis objectifying of whatever is, is accomplished in a settingbefore,\na representing, that aims at bringing each particular\nbeing before it in such a way that man who calculates can be\nsure, and that means be certain, of that being. We first arrive at\nscience as research when and only when truth has been transformed\ninto the certainty of representation. What it is to be is\nfor the first time defined as the objectiveness of representing,\nand truth is first defined as the certainty of representing, in the\nmetaphysics of Descartes. The title of Descartes's principal work\nreads: Meditationes de prima philosophia [Meditations on First\nPhilosophy]. Prote philosophia is the designation coined by Aristotle\nfor what is later called metaphysics. The whole of modern\nmetaphysics taken together, Nietzsche included, maintains itself\nwithin the interpretation of what it is to be and of truth that\nwas prepared by Descartes (Appendix 4).\nNow if science as research is an essential phenomenon of the\nmodem age, it must be that that which constitutes the metaphysical\nground of research determines first and long beforehand\nthe essence of that age generally. The essence of the modern\nage can be seen in the fact that man frees himself from the\nbonds of the Middle Ages in freeing himself to himself. But\n11. The verb stellen, with the meanings to sel in place, to set upon (i.e.,\nto challenge forth), and to supply, is invariably fundamental in Heidegger'.\nunderstanding of the modern age. See in this essay the discussion of the\nsetting in place of the world as pictUre, p. 129. For the use of gtellen to\ncharacterize the manner in which science deals with the real, see SR 167-168\nfor a discussion in which .tellen and the related noun Ge-stell serve centrally\nto characterize and name the essence of technology in this age, see\nQT 14 ff.\n; this correct characterization remains, nevertheless, superficial. It\nleads to those errors that prevent us from comprehending the\nessential foundation of the modern age and, from there, judging\nthe scope of the age's essence. Certainly the modern age has, as\na consequence of the liberation of man, introduced subjectivism\nand individualism. But it remains just as certain that no age\nbefore this one has produced a comparable objectiVism and that\nin no age before this has the non-indiVidual, in the form of the\ncollective, come to acceptance as haVing worth. Essential here\nis the necessary interplay between subjectivism and objectiVism.\nIt is precisely this reciprocal conditioning of one by the other\nthat points back to events more profound. .\nWhat is decisive is not that man frees himself to himself from\nprevious obligations, but that the very essence of man itself\nchanges, in that man becomes subject. We must understand this\nword subiectum, however, as the translation of the Greek\nhypokeimenon. The word names that-which-lies-before, which,\nas ground, gathers everything onto itself. This metaphysical\nmeaning of the concept of subject has first of all no special relationship\nto man and none at all to the I.\nHowever, when man becomes the primary and only real subiectum,\nthat means: Man becomes that being Upon which all\nthat is, is grounded as regards the manner of its Being and its\ntruth. Man becomes the relational center of that which is as such.\nBut this is possible only when the comprehension of what is as\na whole changes. In what does this change manifest itself? What,\nin keeping with it, is the essence of the modern age?\nWhen we reflect on the modern age, we are questioning concerning\nthe modern world picture [Weltbild).'2 We characterize\nthe latter by thrOWing it into relief over against the medieval\nand the ~ncient. world pictures. But Why do we ask concerning\na world picture In OUr interpreting of a historical age? Does every\nperiod of history have its world picture, and indeed in such a\nway as to concern itself from time to time about that world\n12. The conventional translation of WeltbUd would be \"conception of\nt~e wo~!d:' or \"philosophy of life.\" The more literal translation, \"world\npIcture, l~ needed for the following of Heidegger's discussion; but it i.\nwo:!h no:,\"g that \"conception of the world\" bears a dose relatJon to\nHeldegger s theme of man s represen ting of the world as picture.\nThe Age of the World Picture 129\npicture? Or is this, after all, only a modern kind of representing,\nthis asking concerning a world picture?\nWhat is a world picture? Obviously a piCture of the world.\nBut what does \"world\" mean here? What does \"picture\" mean?\n''World'' serves here as a name for what is, in its entirety. The\nname is not limited to the cosmos, to nature. History also belongs\nto the world. Yet even nature and history, and both interpenetrating\nin their underlying and transcending of one another, do\nnot exhaust the world. In this designation the ground of the\nworld is meant also, no matter how its relation to the world is\nthought (Appendix 5).\nWith the word \"picture\" we think first of all of a copy of\nsomething. Accordingly, the world picture would be a painting,\nso to speak, of what is as a whole. But \"world picture\" means\nmore than this. We mean by it the world itself, the world as\nsuch, what is, in its entirety, just as it is normative and binding\nfor us. \"Picture\" here does not mean some imitation, but rather\nwhat sounds forth in the colloquial expression, \"We get the\npicture\" [literally, we are in the picture] concerning something.\nThis means the matter stands before us exactly as it stands with\nit for us. liTo get into the pICture\" [literally, to put oneself into\nthe picture] with respect to something means to set whatever is,\nitself, in place before oneself just in the way that it stands with\nit and to have it fixedly before oneself as set up in this way.\nB~t a decisive determinant in the essence of the picture is still\nmissing. \"We get the picture\" concerning something does n?t\nmean only that what is, is set before us, is represented to us, In\ngeneral, but that what is stands before us-in all that belongs\nto it and all that stands together in it-as a system. \"Te get the\npicture\" throbs with being acquainted with something, with\nbeing eqUipped and prepared for it. Where the world becon:es\npicture, what is, in its entirety, is juxtaposed as that for wh~ch\nman is prepared and which, correspondingly, he therefore mtends\nto bring before himself and have before himself, and\nconsequently intends in a decisive sense to set in place before\nhimself (Appendix 6). Hence world picture, when understood\nessentially, does not mean a picture of the world but the world\nconceived and grasped as picture. What is, in its entirety: is n?w\ntaken in such a way that it first is in being and only is m hemg to the extent that it is set up by man, who represents and sets\nforth.13 Wherever we have the world picture, an essential decision\ntakes ~la~e regarding what is, in its entirety. The Being\nof whatever lS, lS sought and found in the representedness of\nthe latter.\n.However, everywhere that whatever is, is not interpreted in\nthIS way, the world also cannot enter into a picturei there can\nbe no world pictUre. The fact that whatever is comes into being\nin and through representedness transforms the age in which this\noccurs into a new age in contrast with the preceding one. The\nexpressions \"world picture of the modern age\" and \"modern\nworld picture\" both mean the same thing and both assume\nsomething that never could have been before, namely, a medieval\nand an ancient world picture. The world picture does not change\nfrom an earlier medieval one into a modern one, but rather the\nfact that the world becomes picture at all is what distinguishes\nthe essence of the modern age [der Neuzeit].14 For the Middle\nAges, in contrast, that which is, is the ens creatum that which\nis created by the personal Creator-God as the hi~hest cause.\nHere, to be in being means to belong Within a specific rank of\nthe order of what has been created-a rank appointed from the\nbeginning-and as thus caused, to correspond to the cause of\ncreation (analogia entis) (Appendix 7). But never does the Being\nof that which is consist here in the fact that it is brought before\nman as the objective, in the fact that it is placed in the realm of\nman's knoWing and of his having disposal, and that it is in being\nonly in this way.\nThe modern interpretation of that which is, is even further\nfrom the interpretation characteristic of the Greeks. One of the\noldest pro~ou~cements of Greek thinking regarding the Being\nof that which 15 runs: To gar auto noein estin te kai einaP5 This\nsentence of Parmenides means: The apprehending of whatever\nis belongs to Being because it is demanded and determined by\n13. d~rch den \"'Vorstel1enden-herslellenden Mensch.\" gestellt 151,\n14. D,e !Veuzeot is more Iitera.lly \"the new age.\" Having repeatedly used\nthis word in thIS d,SCUSSIon, Heldegger will soon elUcidate the meaning of\nthe \"newness\" of which it speaks (pp. 130 ff\"}\"\n~5. The accepted English translation of this fragment is, \"For thought and\nbeIng are the same thing\" (Nahm).\nThe Age of the World Picture 131\nBeing. That which is, is that which arises and opens itself, which,\nas what presences, comes upon man as the one who presences,\ni.e., comes upon the one who himself opens himself to what\npresences in that he apprehends it. That which is does not come\ninto being at all through the fact that man first looks upon it,\nin the sense of a representing that has the character of subjective\nperception. Rather, man is the one who is looked upon by that\nwhich is i he is the one who is-in company with itselfgathered\ntoward presencing, by that which opens itself. To be\nbeheld by what is, to be included and maintained within its\nopenness and in that way to be borne along by it, to be driven\nabout by its oppositions and marked by its discord-that is the\nessence of man in the great age of the Greeks. Therefore, in order\nto fulfill his essence, Greek man must gather (legein) and save\n(sozein), catch up and preserve/6 what opens itself in its openness,\nand he must remain exposed (aletheuein) to all its sundering\nconfusions. Greek man is as the one who apprehends [deT\nVernehmer] that which is,17 and this is why in the age of the\nGreeks the world cannot become picture. Yet, on the other hand,\nthat the beingness of whatever is, is defined for Plato as eidos\n[aspect, view] is the presupposition, destined far in advance and\nlong ruling indirectly in concealment, for the world's having to\nbecome picture (Appendix 8).\nIn distinction from Greek apprehending, modern representing,\nwhose meaning the word repraesentatio first brings to its earliest\nexpression, intends something quite different. Here to represent\n[vor-stellen] means to bring what is present at hand [das Vorhandene]\nbefore oneself as something standing over against, to\nrelate it to oneself, to the one representing it, and to force it\nback into this relationship to oneself as the normative realm.\nWherever this happens, man \"gets into the picture\" in precedence\nover whatever is. But in that man puts himself into the picture\nin this way, he puts himself into the scene, i.e., into the open\n16. \"Preserve\" translates bewahren, The verb speaks of a preserving that\nas such frees and allows to be manifest. On the connotations resident in\nwahren and related words formed from wahr, see T 42 n. 9.\n17. The noun Vernehme. is related to the verb vernehmen (to hear, to\nperceive, to understand). Vernehmen speaks of an immediate receiving, in\ncontrast to the setting-before (vor-stellen) that arrests and objectifies. sphere of that which is generally and publicly represented.\nTherewith man sets himself up as the setting in which whatever\nis must henceforth set itself forth, must present itself [sich ...\npriisentieren], i.e., be picture. Man becomes the representative\n[der Repriisentant] of that which is, in the sense of that which\nhas the character of object.\nBut the newness in this event by no means consists in the\nfact that now the position of man in the midst of what is, is an\nentirely different one in contrast to that of medieval and ancient\nman. What is decisive is that man himself expressly takes up\nthis position as one constituted by himself, that he intentionally\nmaintains it as that taken up by himself, and that he makes it\nsecure as the solid footing for a possible development of humanity.\nNow for the first time is there any such thing as a\n\"position\" of man. Man makes depend upon himself the way\nin which he must take his stand in relation to whatever is as the\nobjective. There begins that way of being human which mans\nthe realm of human capability as a domain given over to measuring\nand executing, for the purpose of gaining mastery over\nthat which is as a whole. The age that is determined from out\nof this event is, when viewed in retrospect, not only a new one\nin contrast with the one that is past, but it settles itself firmly in\nplace expressly as the new. To be new is peculiar to the world\nthat has become picture.\nWhen, accordingly, the picture character of the world is made\nclear as the representedness of that which is, then in order fully\nto grasp the modem essence of represented ness we must track\nout and expose the original naming power of the worn-out word\nand concept \"to represent\" [vorstellen]: to set out before oneself\nand to set forth in relation to oneself. Through this, whatever\nis comes to a stand as object and in that way alone receives the\nseal of Being. That the world becomes picture is one and the\nsame event with the event of man's becoming 5ubiectum in the\nmidst of that which is (Appendix 9).\nOnly because and insofar as man actually and essentially has\nbecome subject is it necessary for him, as a consequence, to\nconfront the explicit question: Is it as an 'T' confined to its own\npreferences and freed into its own arbitrary choosing or as the\n\"we\" of society; is it as an individual or as a community; is it\nThe Age of the World picture 133\nas a personality within the community or as a mere group\nmember in the corporate body; is it as a state and nation and\nas a people or as the common humanity of modern man, that\nman will and ought to be the subject that in his modern essence\nhe already is? Only where man is essentially already subject\ndoes there exist the possibility of his slipping into the aberration\nof subjectivism in the sense of individualism. But also, only\nwhere man remains subject does the positive struggle against\nindividualism and for the community as the sphere of those goals\nthat govern all achievement and usefulness have any meaning.\nThe interweaving of these two events, which for the modem\nage is decisive-that the world is transformed into picture and\nman into subiectum-throws light at the same time on the\ngrounding event of modern history, an event that at first glance\nseems almost absurd. Namely, the more extensively and the more\neffectually the world stands at man's disposal as conquered, and\nthe more objectively the object appears, all the more subjectively,\nLe., the more importunately, does the 5ubiectum rise up, and all\nthe more impetuously, too, do observation of and teaching about\nthe world change into a doctrine of man, into anthropology. It\nis no wonder that humanism first arises where the world becomes\npicture. It would have been just as impossible for a humanis~\nto have gained currency in the great age of the Greeks as It\nwould have been impossible to have had anything like a wo~ld\npicture in that age. Humanism, therefore, in the more stnct\nhistoriographical sense, is nothing but a moral-aesthetic anthropology.\nThe name \"anthropology\" as used he~e does not mea~\njust some investigation of man by a natural SCIence. Nor does It\nmean the doctrine established within Christian theology of man\ncreated, fallen, and redeemed. It designates that philosophical\ninterpretation of man which explains and evaluates whatever is,\nin its entirety, from the standpoint of man and in relation to\nman (Appendix 10).\nThe increasingly exclusive rooting of the interpretation of the\nworld in anthropology, which has set in since the end of the\neighteenth century, finds its expression in the fact that the\nfundamental stance of man in relation to what is, in its entirety,\nis defined as a world view (Weltanschauung). Since that time\nthis word has been admitted into common usage. As soon as  the world becomes picture, the position of man is conceived as\na world view. To be sure, the phrase \"world view\" is open to\nmisunderstanding, as though it were merely a matter here of a\npassive contemplation of the world. For this reason, already in\nthe nineteenth century it was emphasized with jUstification that\n\"world view\" also meant and even meant primarily \"view of\nlife.\" The fact that, despite this, the phrase \"world view\" asserts\nitself as the name for the position of man in the midst of all\nthat is, is proof of how decisively the world became picture as\nsoon as man brought his life as subiectum into precedence over\nother centers of relationship. This means: whatever is, is considered\nto be in being only to the degree and to the extent that\nit is taken into and referred back to this life, i.e., is lived out,\nand becomes life-experience. Just as unsuited to the Greek spirit\nas every humanism had to be, just so impossible was a medieval\nworld view, and just as absurd is a Catholic world view. Just as\nnecessarily and legitimately as everything must change into lifeexperience\nfor modem man the more unlimitedly he takes charge\nof the shaping of his essence, just so certainly could the Greeks\nat the Olympian festivals never have had life-experiences.\nThe fundamental event of the modem age is the conquest of\nthe world as picture. The word \"picture\" [BUd] now means the\nstructured image [GebildJ that is the creature of man's prodUcing\nwhich represents and sets before.is In such producing, man contends\nfor the position in which he can be that particular being\nwho gives the measure and draws up the guidelines for everything\nthat is. Because this position secures, organizes, and articulates\nitseJf as a world view, the modem relationship to that\nwhich is, is one that becomes, in its decisive unfolding, a confrontation\nof world viewsj and indeed not of random world\nviews, but only of those that have already taken up the fundamental\nposition of man that is most extreme, and have done\n18. Gebild is Heidegger's own word. The noun Gebilde means thing\nfonned, creation, structure, image. Gebild is here taken to be dose to it in\nmeaning, and it is assumed-with the use of \"structured\" -that Heidegger\nintends the force of the prefix ge-, which connotes a gathering, to be found\nin the word (d. QT 19 ff.). \"Man's producing which represents and sets before\"\ntranslates des varSle/lenden Hers/ellens.\nThe Age of the World Picture 135\nsO with the utmost resoluteness. For the sake of this struggle\nof world views and in keeping with its meaning, man brings into\nplay his unlimited power for the calculating, planning, and\nmolding of all things. Science as research is an absolutely necessary\nform of this establishing of self in the world; it is one of\nthe pathways upon which the modern age rages toward fulfillment\nof its essence, with a velocity unknown to the participants.\nWith this struggle of world views the modem age first\nenters into the part of its history that is the most decisive and\nprobably the most capable of enduring (Appendix 11).\nA sign of this event is that everywhere and in the most varied\nforms and disguises the gigantic is making its appearance. In 50\ndoing, it evidences itself simultaneously in the tendency toward\nthe increasingly small. We have only to think of numbers in\natomic physics. The gigantic presses forward in a form that\nactually seems to make it disappear-in the annihilation of great\ndistances by the airplane, in the setting before us of foreign and\nremote worlds in their everydayness, which is produced at random\nthrough radio by a flick of the hand. Yet we think too\nsuperficially if we suppose that the gigantic is only the endlessly\nextended emptiness of the purely quantitative. We think too\nlittle if we find that the gigantic, in the form of continual notever-\nhaving-been-here-yet, originates only in a blind mania for\nexaggerating and excelling. We do not think at all if we believe\nwe have explained this phenomenon of the gigantic with the\ncatchword \"Americanism\" (Appendix 12).\nThe gigantic is rather that through which the quantitative becomes\na special quality and thus a remarkable kind of greatness.\nEach historical age is not only great in a distinctive way in contrast\nto others; it also has, in each instance, its own concept of\ngreatness. But as soon as the gigantic in planning and calculating\nand adjusting and making secure shifts over out of the quantitative\nand becomes a special quality, then what is gigantic, and\nwhat can seemingly always be calculated completely, becomes,\nprecisely through thiS, incalculable. This becoming incalculable\nremains the invisible shadow that is cast around all things\neverywhere when man has been transformed into subiectum and By means of this shadow the d\ninto a space withdrawn from re mo ern :\",orld extends itself out\nincalculable the d t' presentatIon, and so lends to the\n. e ermmateness peculiar to it a 11 h'\ntoncal uniqueness.

And since these cells, in the last three \ndecades of Silicon Valley exploits, have shrunk to spatial extensions \nof less than one micrometer, our writing scene may well be defined \nby a self-similarity of letters over some six orders of decimal magni- \ntude. This state of affairs does not only make a difference to history, \nin which, at its alphabetical beginning, a camel and its hebraic letter \ngame1 were just two and a half orders of decimal magnitude apart. It \nalso seems to hide the very act of writing. \nAs one knows without saying, we do not write anymore. The \ncrazy kind of software engineering that was writing suffered from an \nincurable confirneon befiuent we and mention. Up to Holderlin’s time, a \nmere mention of lightning seems to have been sufficient evidence of \nits possible poetic use. Nowadays, after this lightning’s metamor- \nphosis into electricity, manmade writing passes instead through \nmicroscopically written inscriptions, which, in contrast to all histor- \nical writing tools, are able to read and write by themselves. The last \nhistorical act of writing may well have been the moment when, in the \nearly seventies, the Intel engineers laid out some dozen square \nmeters of blueprint paper (64 square meters in the case of the later \n8086) in order to desi_gn the hardware architecture of their first inte- \ngrated microprocessor. This manual layout of two thousand transis- \ntors and their interconnections was then miniaturized to the size of \nan actual chip and, by electro-optical machines, written into silicon \n147 Frirdrirb Kittlrr \nlayers. Finally, this 4004-microprocessor found its place in the new \ndesk calculators of Intel’s Japanese customer,’ and our postmodern \nwriting scene could begin. Actually, the hardware complexity of \nmicroprocessors simply discards such manual design techniques. In \norder to lay out the next computer generation, the engineers, instead \nof filling countless meters of blueprint paper, have recourse to \nComputer Aided Design, that is, to the geometrical or autorouting \npowers of the actual generation. \nIn constructing the first integrated microprocessor, however, \nIntel’s Marcian E. Hoff had given an almost perfect demonstration of \na Turing machine. After 1937, computing, whether done by men or \nby machines, can be formalized as a countable set of instructions \noperating on an infinitely long paper band and the discrete signs \nthereon. Turing’s concept of such a paper machine: whose opera- \ntions consist only of writing and reading, proceeding and receding, \nhas proven to be the mathematical equivalent of any computable \nfunction. Universal Turing machines, when fed the insauctions of \nany other machine, can imitate it effectively. Thus, precisely because \neventual differences between hardware implementations do not \ncount anymore, the so-called Church-Turing hypothesis in its \nstrongest or physical form is tantamount to declaring nature itself a \nuniversal Turing machine. \nThis claim in itself has had the effect of duplicating the implo- \nsion of hardware by an explosion of software. Programming lan- \nguages have eroded the monopoly of ordinary language and grown \ninto a new hierarchy of their own. This postmodern Tower of \nBabel reaches from simple operation codes whose linguistic exten- \nsion is still a hardware configuration, passing through an assembler \nwhose extension is this very opcode, up to high-level programming \nlanguages whose extension is that very assembler. In consequence, \nfar-reaching chains of self-similarities in the sense defined by frac- \ntal theory organize the software as well as the hardware of every \nwriting. What remains a problem is only recognizing these layers \nwhich, like modem media technologies in general, have been explic- \nitly connived to evade perception. tlre simply do not know what our \nwriting does. \nTo wordprocess a text, that is, to become oneself a paper \nmachine working on an IBLM AT under Microsoft DOS, one must \n148 Tbrrr Is No Softwotc \nfirst of all buy some commercial files. Unless these files show the \nfile extension names of EXE or of COM, wordprocessing under \nDOS could never start. The reason is that only COM- and EXE- \nfiles entertain a peculiar relation to their proper names. On the one \nhand, they bear grandiloquent names like Wordperfect, on the \nother hand, more or less cryptic, because nonvocalized, acronyms \nlike WP. The full name, alas, serves only the advertising strategies \nof software manufacturers, since DOS as a microprocessor operat- \ning system cannot read file names longer than eight letters. That is \nwhy the unpronounceable acronym W, this posthistoric revoca- \ntion of a fundamental Greek innovation, is not only necessary, but \namply sufficient for postmodern wordprocessing. In fact, it seems to \nbring back truly magical power. WP does what it says. Executable \ncomputer files encompass, by cona-ast not only to Wordperfect but \nalso to big but empty Old European words such as the Mind or the \nWord, all the routines and data necessary to their self-constitution. \nSurely, tapping the letter sequence WP and Enter on an AT key- \nboard does not make the Word perfect, but this simple writing act \nstarts the actual execution of Wordperfect. Such are the triumphs \nof software. \nThe accompanying papenvare cannot but multiply these magic \npowers. Written to bridge the gap between formal and everyday lan- \nguages, electronics and literature, the usual software manuals intro- \nduce the program in question as a linguistic agent ruling with near \nomnipotence over the computer system’s resources, address spaces, \nand other hardware parameters: WP, when called with command \nline argument X, would change the monitor Screen from color A to \nB, start in mode C, return finally to D, etc. ad infinitum. \nIn fact, however, these actions of agent WP are virtual ones, \nsince each of them (as the saying goes) has to run under DOS. It is \nthe operating system and, more precisely, its command shell that \nscans the keyboard for eight-bit file names on the input line, trans- \nforms some relative addresses of an eventually retrieved file into \nabsolute ones, loads this new version from external mass memory to \nthe necessary random access space, and finally or temporarily passes \nexecution to the opcode lines of a slave named Wordperfect. \nThe same argument would hold for DOS, which, in the final \nanalysis, resolves into an extension of the basic input and output sys- \n149 Frirdricb Kittlrr \ntem called BIOS. Not only no program, but also no underlying \nmicroprocessor system could ever start without the rather incredible \nautobooting faculty of some elementary functions that, for safety’s \nsake, are burnt into silicon and thus form part of the hardware. Any \ntransformation of matter from entropy to information, from a million \nsleeping transistors into differences between electronic potentials, \nnecessarily presupposes a material event called reset. \nIn principle, this kind of descent from software to hardware, \nfrom higher to lower levels of observation, could be continued over \nmore and more orders of magnitude. All code operations, despite \nsuch metaphoric faculties as call or return, come down to absolutely \nlocal smng manipulations, that is, I am afraid, to sign$m ofvoltage \ndflmmcs. Formalization in Hilbert’s sense does away with theory \nitself, insofar as “the theory is no longer a system of meaningful \npropositions, but one of sentences as sequences of words, which are \nin turn sequences of letters. We can tell [say] by reference to the \nform alone which combinations of the words are sentences, which \nsentences are ",

Writing in\ngeneral and books in particular are said to be obsolete, while the image, more powerful and\nunifying than ever, is poised to reclaim its old rights. I would like to challenge this enthusiasm\nand the diagnosis it is based on with the counterargument that the book is not simply at the\nend of its tether. Rather, it was a singular medium that had the power to facilitate its own\ntechnological supersession; and that particular power (and the source of much of Europe's\npolitical power) was not derived from its printed words alone, but from a technologically\nsophisticated media link that joined these words to printed images.\nMedia theorists-that is, Marshall McLuhan and, in his wake, Vilem Flusser-made an absolute\ndistinction between writing and pictures which, ultimately, was expressed in geometric terms:\nthe one-dimensionality of printed books stood in clear contrast to the irreducible twodimensionality\nof pictures. In final, simplified analysis this may be true, especially given that\ntoday's computerized text can be modeled as strings. But it elides a simple fact that was\nemphasized, not coincidentally, by Michel Butor, a nouveau romancier: the most widely used\nbooks-from the Bible to the telephone directory-are not read in a linear fashion at all. And\nwith good reason: ever since Gutenberg, printed lines are as linear as book pages, since the\nage of twelfth-century scholastics, have been two-dimensional.1 All paragraphs, sections,\nfootnotes, and headings are placed on a surface whose two-dimensionality is in no way\ndistinct from that of pictures. As well-as Michael Giesecke has emphasized time and againthe\nfact that Gutenberg's movable types were designed not with mass production in mind, but\nin order to compete with the calligraphic elegance of handcrafted manuscript pages, further\ntestifies to the pictorial origin of the printing press (which was, after all, nothing but a\nsobered-up winepress).2\nWhile still residing in Strasbourg, and prior to his move to Mainz where he embarked on\nreproducing Bibles and calendars, Johann Gutenberg had been busy reproducing pictures of\nsaints. Nonetheless, the geometry of the letters of Mainz was different from that of the icons\nof Strasbourg. As Sigmund Freud pointed out, \"letters of the alphabet\"-as opposed to faces-\n\"do not occur in nature.\"3 Since everything depended on putting individual letters in their\nplace, Gutenberg's print technology required a spatial geometry. Each lead letter was located\nin relation to its neighbor to the right, left, top, and bottom; in other words, each letter filled\nan empty space that was already waiting for it. Thus the typographic standardization of\nwriting merely continued the standardization of numerals brought about by the medieval\nimport of the Indo-Arabic place-value system. Zero-a sign wholly unknown to the Greeks and\nRomans-had referred all other numerals to their spaces, just as did the space that Gutenberg\nturned into lead and Mallarme into poetry.4 It was not until the possibility existed to replace\nthe empty space by any letter that the inner ability to write was transformed into the\nmateriality of the letter case. Writing in the age of its technological reproducibility is a\ncombinatorics of standardized elements or characters, just as the old Greek vowel alphabet\nhad been a combinatorics of a finite number of elements or letters.\nThe Greek stocheia or letters did not give birth only to the four elements of antiquity or the\none hundred and twenty chemical elements of today: Elements was also the name of a book\nthat for more than two millennia taught Greeks, Arabs, and Europeans the axioms of\ngeometry. The current enthusiastic scholarly rediscovery of images, bodies, and natures tends\nto forget that elements exist only in sets-that is, in code systems-which is why Euclid's\nElements became a very different book once it entered the Gutenberg galaxy in 1482. It was\nRegiomontanus himself, who had imported the new Arabic trigonometry to Europe and, in\nparticular, to Albrecht Durer's home town of Nurnberg, who assisted in subjecting Euclid's\nrediscovered manuscript to the geometry of print. Ever since 1482 every axiom that defines\npoint, line, or plane in writing has been accompanied by a typographic definition: the point\nappears as a point, the line as a line, and so on, until mathematics (to use Sybille Kramer's\nterm) has become a \"typographic\" event.5 And once the points at either end of such a printed\nline are marked with letters that recur in the accompanying text, the geometric figure has\nobtained a name with which it and all its parts can be addressed. This may seem pretty evident\nto us whenever we look at technical or mathematical illustrations, but that is not at all the\ncase. \"How greatly this page here resembles a thousand other pages, / and how hard it is to be\nflabbergasted at that!\" Hans Magnus Enzensberger begins his poem in praise of Johann\nGensfleisch zu Gutenberg.6 The very same applies to Regiomontanus, his printer Ratolf, and\nscientific visualization in general. What counts today in the slow transition from European\nhistory to computer-aided posthistoire is neither mass movements nor gods of battle, but\nminor insignificant games of the signifier that (in Lacan's words) are shaking the moorings of\nour being.\nNone of Gutenberg's contemporaries understood the mathematization at the base of printing\nfaster than Leon Battista Alberti, the noble Florentine architect, painter, and mathematician.7\nAlberti himself tells the story of how one fine day in 1462 or 1463 he was strolling through\nthe Vatican gardens accompanied by one Dato, who, as his name already indicates, worked as\na papal cipher secretary. As is well known, all modern diplomacy evolved from the secret\nsecretariats and chancelleries of the Roman curia and the Venetian Signoria. Alberti,\nhowever, was talking about the exact opposite of cryptography: in passing, he mentioned that\nthe man from Mainz had once again copied, and thus presumably saved from oblivion,\nanother irreplaceable antique manuscript. This must have prompted the papal cryptographer's\nresponse that, unfortunately, his wearisome task of replacing one letter after the other with\nanother letter could unfortunately not be mechanized that easily. Whereupon Alberti took pen\nin hand and produced a treatise that was to become the basis of modern cryptography.\nAntique cryptography, developed by Julius Caesar and adopted by Augustus, had been a\nsimple game with the Latin vowel alphabet: the two Caesars simply moved each letter one or\nmore places down the alphabet so that A turned into B, B into C, C into D, and so on. The\ngreat Augustus, however, never grasped that his letter game was a modular arithmetic: X, the\nlast letter of his alphabet, did not turn back into A but into an exceptional AA.8 Such\nprimitive keys-which were still in operation in his lifetime-posed no difficulty for Alberti; he\nmerely counted how often individual letters occurred in the Latin or Italian cleartexts, and\nthen compared the result to the letter-- frequency in the cryptogram. In other words: Alberti\nsimply transferred into cryptanalysis the elementary principle of Gutenberg's letter case,\nwhich was itself already a letter-frequency analysis since it had to provide more lead types for\nfrequent letters than for rare ones.\nAlberti approached cryptography or encipherment in the same way. To surpass the simplicity\nof the Caesarian code, he constructed a cipher disk made up of two concentric rings. The\ncircumference of each ring was divided into twenty-four parts or cells, each of which\ncontained a letter, so that moving the outer ring changed the correspondence between the two\nalphabets. The encipherer had only to copy one correspondence before moving the outer disk\none place further. The painstaking craft of Dato and his colleagues had become a mechanics\nof movable letters in the strictly Gutenbergian sense of the word. Thus Alberti lived up fully\nto his Roman conversation: with a letter-frequency analysis for deciphering and a\npolyalphabetic code for enciphering, he presented Europe with the principle, or the power, of\nits strategic secrets. Around 1570, Giorgio Vasari's summary of Alberti's life in his Artists of\nthe Renaissance already drew a parallel between Gutenberg and Alberti-though, significantly\nenough, between not print and cryptography, but print and perspective. Vasari claimed that in\n\"1457, the year when Johann Gutenberg discovered his very useful method for printing books,\nAlberti similarly discovered a way of tracing natural perspectives and effecting the diminution\nof figures, as well as a method of reproducing small objects on a large scale: these were very\ningenious and fascinating discoveries, of great value for the purposes of art.\"9 Vasari's\npostdating of Gutenberg's invention by ten years obviously grew from early modern\nchauvinism: if Germany had presented such a useful art to the world, then Italy \"similarly\"\nwould have had to do so in the very same year. The artisan-engineers of both countries had\ndrawn even, though it remains unclear what kind of instrument Vasari's badly informed\naccount was referring to. Following another Alberti biographer, researchers believe that the\ndevice for diminishing and enlarging images was in fact a camera obscura: \"By way of\npainting,\" this anonymous biographer wrote, \"Alberti produced many unbelievable things\nwhich could be perceived by looking through the narrow opening in a small box. High\nmountains were to be seen and wide landscapes surrounding the immeasurable sea, and things\nthat were so far removed from the eye that they could not be distinguished. These things he\ncalled demonstrations, and they were made in such a way that the experienced as well as the\nunskilled believed that they were looking at actual phenomena rather than at paintings.\"10\nProvided that the anonymous biographer is more trustworthy than Vasari, it appears that\nAlberti's demonstrations enlarged what was at a distance and reduced what was close,\nfollowing a projection technology that channels natural phenomena through the narrow\nopening of a camera obscura. Alberti had replaced painting as a craft-which it remained at\nleast until the invention of photography-with an optical media technology. By implementing\nthe perspectival geometry of our vision with the help of a diaphragm and projection screen,\nthe camera obscura generated reproductions that were as free from mistakes as Gutenberg's\nprinted books. This, it seems, is the crux of Vasari's Italo-German heroic epic.\nThe clerics witnessing the printing of the first edition of the 1485 Regensburg missal\nmarveled at it as a \"divine work of God\": after comparing all the copies of the missal with the\ncomposition pattern, they concluded that \"the letters, syllables, words, sentences, periods,\nparagraphs and all other aspects of the printed copies corresponded exactly to the original in\nour church .... Praised be the Lord.\"11 The \"experienced and unskilled\" who peered into\nAlbert's camera obscura must have been equally happy and impressed by the way in which it\nreflected natural phenomena rather than paintings. Two contemporaneous technologies had\ntaken on the task of eliminating the human hand as a source of noise and pollution from texts\nand pictures. At one and the same historical moment, books and paintings entered the age of\ntheir technological-that is to say, noisefree-reproduction.\nIn light of all this it comes as no surprise that the two reproduc tion technologies were to\nmerge into one. The one geometry expounded in Euclid's incunabulum came to provide the\nelements for the production of texts and images; and it was none other than Alberti who\ninitiated this integration. In 1435, less than ten years prior to Gutenberg's first printed Bible,\nAlberti wrote his Treatise on Painting (though it was not be printed until 1540). Not only did\nit turn a form of knowledge that hitherto had been passed on orally from masters to\napprentices into a theory that could be acquired autodidactically, it was also the first\npresentation on paper of the silent technique of perspective.\nThe first of Alberti's three books on painting took off where the 1482 edition of Euclid was\nsupposed to continue: with the geometric definition of point, line, and plane. Alberti,\nhowever, used Greek mathematics toward an end that had been wholly alien to antiquity: for\nthe construction of pictures. The three dimensions are merely defined in order to introduce the\nfourth dimension-that is to say, the space of buildings and natural phenomena. Alberti's\ntreatise teaches the painter to achieve with crayon and ruler precisely that which his camera\nobscura was able to do on its own. Right angles become obtuse, identical distances become\ndifferent, and parallel lines turn into bundles of rays emanating from an infinitely distant\nvanishing point, until the completed painting has transformed all three spatial dimensions into\ntheir perspectival appearance. Half a millennium before Macintosh and Windows 95, the\npainting assumes the logical position of a window onto which the world graphically projects\nitself. And because Alberti (as if to conjure up a canvas) depicts this window as a\nsemitransparent veil woven from a multitude of crisscrossing canvas threads, each detail of\nthe world finds its own little square that belongs to it alone. As was the case with Gutenberg,\na grid of right angles refers all data back to place values, which is why the comparison with\ntoday's desktop operating systems is not farfetched. The pixels on our computer monitors\ndiffer from television images in that they can be fully addressed as a two-dimensional matrix.\nPrecisely for this reason it is possible to convert the monitor to text mode, which just like\ntypography is based on place value. Thus, Alberti's theory of perspective not only turned art\ninto writing, it also turned visual space into paper.\nBut all this labor of windows and veils, projection planes and vertical projection, obscured the\nsad fact that Alberti could not calculate his perspectival paintings. Just as in the case of the\ncamera obscura, technical processes replaced calculations. For, according to Alberti's\ninnocuous explanation, one could not expect painters to deal with a mathematics that\ntransformed right angles into obtuse ones and integral ratios into irrational ones. But this kind\nof mathematics was about to evolve, as Regiomontanus imported the knowledge of Arab\ntrigonometrists (though not their passion for the camera obscura) to Europe. It was precisely\nthis type of mathematics that Alberti may have gotten to know when he met Regiomontanus\nin Rimini. Unfortunately, we will never know what the artisan-engineers talked about.\nLinear perspective was nonetheless able to transfer visibilities onto paper, even without the\nmodern trick of paper to solve equations. The question was, however, which visibilities were\ncompatible with (to quote a famous Mirer title) compass and ruler. The fractal complexities of\nwoods and trees were obviously not, simply because a geometry devoid of right angles cannot\nbe transformed into an affine geometry of obtuse angles. In other words: the very visibilities\nwith which linear perspective began its modern triumphant progress had to be constructions\nthemselves. As we all know, ever since Egyptian and Babylonian times Europe has been\ncherishing right angles.\nNot coincidentally, Alberti dedicated his treatise to an architect who in 1420 had introduced\nthe first perspectival painting to the amazed Florentines. As the subject of his painting Filippo\nBrunelleschi chose an edifice the doors of which he had designed himself: the Florentine\nBaptistery. Thus linear perspective began as an architectural drawing, as the affine, twodimensional\nrepresentation of a three-dimensional octagon. The fact that Brunelleschi's\npainting also contained clouds and other fractals does not contradict this in the least: for,\nunlike the Baptistery, Brunelleschi did not paint the sky, but left it as an empty background\nand inserted a mirror instead. In the eye of the observer assuming his preassigned place in the\ncenter of Florence, wandering clouds and solid stones, mirror reflection and painted illusion,\nmerged into a virtual reality.\nIn other words, linear perspective as a technological construction had the goal of reproducing\ntechnological constructions. In strict accordance with McLuhan, the content of a medium is\nnever nature but always another medium. Just as Gutenberg's printing press technologized\nhandwriting, so did Brunelleschi's linear perspective technologize architecture. Hence it\ncomes as no surprise that print and perspective entered a feedback loop. Not only did\nchurches and baptisteries find their way into print and pictures, but so did the technical\ndiapositives that enabled perspective paintings in the first place. The camera obscura that\nAlberti, if not Brunelleschi, had first used to reproduce what could be seen, could itself be\nreproduced in perspectival manner. As woodcuts or copper engravings, whose lines (like\nEuclid's geometric constructions) were once more named with telling letters, the principle of\nthe camera obscura passed from autodidact to autodidact. Just like the proverbial dwarfs\nperched on the shoulders of giants, aspiring painters and engineers simply had to place\nthemselves in the preassigned subject position in order to see farther and farther. All that\nEuropean modernity has come to celebrate as progress is based on this feedback loop between\nmathematics, print, and perspective.\nAlberti's pre-Gutenbergian book on perspective first appeared in manuscript form in 1435 and\nwas not printed until 1540. In contrast, Durer's 1525 Manual of Measurement of Lines, Areas,\nand Solids by Means of Compass and Ruler, a direct sequel to Alberti, concluded with a\npraise to \"the Lord\" and a stern warning against all unauthorized reprinting.12 Where Alberti\nhad been restricted to words only, Durer was able to publish words and images. The painter's\nmanual concludes with technical drawings designed to illustrate Durer's theory of linear\nperspective. The painter, as it were, reproduces himself as well as his technical diapositive\nand his painterly subject matter. As a result Durer's manual is in stylistic terms no longer a\ntheory, but a sequence of instructions that oblige the reader to reenact text and image:\nYou can render anything within reach in correct perspective by means of three threads and\ndraw it on the table as follows:\nIf you are in a large chamber, hammer a large needle with a wide eye into the wall. It will\ndenote the near point of sight. Then thread it with a strong thread, weighted with a piece of\nlead. Now place a table as far from the needle as you wish and place a vertical frame on it ....\nThis frame should have a door hinged to it which will serve as your tablet for painting. Now\nnail two threads to the top and middle of the frame. These should be as long, respectively, as\nthe frame's width and length, and they should be left hanging. Next, prepare a long iron\npointer with a needle's eye at its other end, and attach it to the long thread which leads\nthrough the needle that is attached to the wall. Hand this pointer to another person, while you\nattend to the threads which are attached to the frame. Now proceed as follows. Place a lute or\nanother object to your liking as far from the frame as you wish, but so that it will not move\nwhile you are using it. Have your assistant then move the pointer from point to point on the\nlute, and as often as he rests in one place and stretches the long thread, move the two threads\nattached to the frame crosswise and in straight lines to confine the long thread. Then stick\ntheir ends with wax to the frame, and ask your assistant to relax the tension of the long thread.\nNext close the door of the frame and mark the spot where the threads cross the tablet. After\nthis, open the door again and continue with another point, moving from point to point until the\nentire lute has been scanned and its points have been transferred to the tablet. Then connect\nall the points on the tablet and you will see the result.13\nI have quoted Durer at length in order to show what, in 1525, printed book illustrations had\nmade of linear perspective. All the instructions issued by text and image can easily be\nformalized: \"Do this as long as x applies; do that whenever y applies; repeat this until z no\nlonger applies, and so on.\" What Direr presents as perspectival construction by way of writing\nand illustration is something we are far more familiar with than his contemporaries. It is an\nalgorithm, the Europeanized name of a great Arab mathematician. As opposed to mechanisms\nand theories, algorithms are defined by two things: unlike mechanisms, they do not simply\nproceed and take their course, but are subject to conditional jumps and loops; but unlike\ntheories, they have to come to an end despite all jumps and loops. \"After this, open the door\nagain and continue with another point, moving from point to point until the entire lute has\nbeen scanned and its points have been transferred to the tablet. Then connect all the points\nand you will see the result.\"\nThus the discursive order that has been in place since the days of Kant and that decrees that\nart is no technology and technology is no art, did not apply at all to the Brunelleschis,\nAlbertis, or Durers, the painters and architects of the Renaissance. On the contrary: Mirer's\nalgorithmic perspective corresponds to present-day computer graphics and electronic music.\nFollowing an algorithm does not yield the musical instrument we know as lute, but a finite\nnumber of contour points; otherwise, the attempt to produce the silhouette with an infinite\nnumber of points would terminate in a vicious feedback loop. In other words, the painter does\nexactly the same thing that today's digital-analog converters of our computer monitors or\nsound systems do: he transforms a discrete number of points into a constant function.\nEnzensberger's poem on the inventor of the Raderuhr contains the lines: \"Different words and\nwheels. But / the same sky. / That's the Dark Ages we still / live in today.\"14 But we live in\nthese dark ages not because movable type and linear perspective emerge from the laws of\ntechnology, let alone from the essence of things. We reside within the space of these\ninventions only because they were contingent. They are a European heritage that was (and is)\nthe source of Europe's power. Even the fact that print and perspective have now achieved a\nglobal and innocuous dominance is a result of that power. Nineteenth-century gunboats, Bible\nclubs, and machine guns finally managed to convert the whole world to movable type and\nperspectival vanishing points.\nBut that was not always the case.15 Around 1620, shortly after the formation of a propaganda\noffice in the Vatican, the Society of Jesus resolved to bequeath print and perspective to all\npeoples and empires. To this end, a Gutenberg printing press was installed in Beijing, in the\nmiddle of the Middle Kingdom. As if paper, following its long detour from China over Arabia\nand Sicily to Mainz and beyond, had found its way back home, the Jesuits at first proceeded\nto convert the simple Chinese with simply illustrated Bibles. This failed to impress the Son of\nHeaven; converting an emperor required a more advanced European technology. Father\nJohannes Admann Schall von Bell, Matteo Ricci's successor in Beijing, imported from Rome\nan entire scientific library that contained no fewer than nineteen titles on perspective. All\nseemed set to bless China not only with reproducible texts, but also with equally reproducible\ndrawings. But pride and/or delusion intervened, to the effect that missionary headquarters in\ndistant Rome, not its outlet in Beijing, made a fateful decision: the natives who were to be\ninstructed in the arts of engraving and perspective were not Chinese but Japanese from the\nChristian enclave in Nagasaki. In Nagasaki, however, tracts like those by Alberti or Durer\nwere unavailable.\nThe outcome was inevitable. In 1627 Father Schall von Bell decided to print four ambitious\nvolumes full of \"diagrams and explanations of curious machines from the Far West\" in order\nto confront the emperor of China with superior European technology.16 These so-called\ntheaters of machines, a type of book that not coincidentally first flourished in the Renaissance,\nusually contained exact perspectival copper engravings or wood prints of existing or fictitious\nmachines-drawings, in other words, that would enable observers to construct threedimensional\nmachines from their two-dimensional representations. Schall's native\n(presumably Japanese) illustrators went to work; but although they had European theater-ofmachine\nbooks complete with Chinese translations in front of them, they were unable to copy\nthe correct perspective of the originals.\nEven worse, the illustrators did not seem to notice that, just like medieval copyists, they\nsmuggled many mistakes into their reproductions. Thus water and pulp mills that nobody\ncould have built circulated in magnificent volumes that nobody doubted, but from which\nnobody learned anything. According to Samuel Edgerton, these faulty graphics were still\npublished in Chinese encyclopedias and scientific handbooks until the first decades of the\nnineteenth century. The results are well known. China, once the technologically superior idol\nof a medieval Europe, remained on a level that made it easy for Britain and other European\npowers to win one colonial war after the other. The Chinese simply were no subjects-that is to\nsay, in the most literal sense of the word: they did not subject themselves to linear\nperspective. They preferred to remain loyal to Confucius or Lao-Tse.\nSuch was the dismal outcome for the technology transfer from West to East. In the opposite\ndirection, however, things worked out splendidly: it was a technology transfer from Beijing to\nHanover that made it possible to conceptualize print and perspective. The very same Jesuits\nwho in vain had tried to impose European print technology had also studied old Chinese\nmanuscripts and described them to a German philosopher. What Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\ncame across in his global correspondence, however, was not the contents of the I-Ching but\nits signs. He discovered that twenty-six alphabetic signs and even ten Indo-Arabic numerals\nwere a needless expenditure when it came to describing Being in its totality: the I-Ching or\nBook of Changes makes do with yin and yang, a whole and a broken line.\nBased on this semiotic economy described to him by the Jesuit priests, Leibniz drew the\nstartling conclusion that all signs are replaceable, even and especially the acclaimed Indo-\nArabic numerals. In a dedicatory epistle to the Duke of Hanover, he explained that two signs\nwould suffice to describe the world in its entirety. For reasons both theological and\ntypographical, however, these signs were named Zero and One, rather than yin and yang.\nLeibniz, who had subjected (and, if necessary, corrected) all mathematical signs to\nGutenberg's place-value logic, recognized in Zero the nothingness preceding creation, and in\nOne, divine creation itself. No wonder, then, that his binary system was said to have been able\nto describe the whole of being.\nBut zero and one also describe something else. As a philosopher as well as the founder of\nanalytic geometry, Descartes declared the world to be a three-dimensional space that was,\nquite literally, opposed by a thinking subject as a nondimensional point. The monadology of\nLeibniz went a step further by presenting the subject as a paradoxical punctiform architecture\nwithout windows in which the whole word appears nonetheless, simply because the monad\nhas no windows but is a camera obscura.17 Creation or One can coincide with a monad or\nzero if that zero is always already the point of sight of linear perspective.\nIn other words, ever since Leibniz, print and perspective rule not only over so-called nature\nbut also over so-called thought. A secondorder geometry, as the Chinese taught the most\nmathematically inclined of all philosophers, turned signs themselves into technologies. This\ntypographic mathematics-to use Sybille Kramer's term -is powerful enough to retire the very\nmedia link that enabled it in the first place. Mirer's strange lute algorithm was based on a\ncoupling of print, perspective, and learned craftsmanship; hence, it had to be addressed in\nsimple Early New High German. Leibniz, in turn, replaced movable type with the even more\nmovable symbols of his algebra, and perspectival nature with perspectival thought; hence, he\nwas able to address algorithms that could do without any human handwork. In his calculating\nmachine, which earned him membership in the London Royal Society, addition and\nsubtraction, multiplication and division proceeded on their own. He had brought forth a\nmachine whose end product needed neither print nor paper (though this did not keep the\nmachine from appearing in the shape of printed blueprints). The successors of Leibniz only\nneeded to look things up in order to widen the gap between human language and scientific\ntechnology. The media link of print and perspective enabled technological media-that is, it\nenabled the supersession of the media link that gave birth to it. The camera obscura evolved\ninto cameras and computer screens, and movable letters evolved into movable electrons in\nsilicon chips and, in the near future, into quantum transistors.\nBut this implies that the books we understand and the pictures we recognize are no more than\na subset of a set of signs that defy all hermeneutics. What we have instead is a second-order\ngeometry in which signs and atomic states configure themselves. The very last theory of\ngeometry produced by Europe two thousand years after Euclid announces this is in a manner\nboth comic and threatening. David Hilbert's Foundations of Geometry, published in Leipzig\nin 1899, was based on the axiom that the venerable tradition of visualizing points, lines, and\nplanes is completely redundant. Instead of dealing with points, lines, and planes, Hilbert\nwrote, he could just as well have written about \"'chairs', 'tables' and `beer mugs.\"18 This\nsocalled formalism, however, included a second-order visualization of the signs themselves.\nAs if Regiomontanus's edition of Euclid had really caught on, Hilbert referred to his symbols\nas \"discrete objects, which as immediate experience precede all thought\"; even more succinctthat\nis to say, even more theological or, as in the case of Leibniz, atheistic-was his\npronouncement, \"In the beginning was the sign.\"19\nAs we all know, in the beginning was the word, and the word has become flesh-and as such it\nentered print with Gutenberg's Bible and the camera obscura with Brunelleschi's perspective.\nThe sign that was in the beginning, by contrast, has become flesh in digital computers during\nHilbert's lifetime, and much to his dismay. Alan Turing simply needed to take his master\nliterally and to feed signs that, as \"discrete objects,\" \"precede all thought,\" to machines rather\nthan mathematicians to truly put an end to the history of Europe less than two years before the\noutbreak of the Second World War.\nAs you will have guessed, all my digressions were simply no more than a detour, a shortcircuit\nbetween today and today. I simply did not want to once again tell the same old story of\nhow machines (according to Turing's oracle of 1948) have assumed power. But maybe these\ndigressions were not as redundant as the alphabet or the decimal system. In the politically\ncorrect nightmares that would like to bomb us back into an ecologically sound Stone Age,\ncomputers appear as homeless monsters hovering like vampires over a culture of books and\npictures. In turn, in the fantasies of software magnates, books and pictures are just so much\nloot awaiting digital reproduction. For all their emphasis on pedagogy or economy, both\nfantasies forget that culture cannot be had without technology and technology cannot be had\nwithout culture. The \"end of art\" (to quote Hegel) could only emerge from art itself. Against\nthese fantasies one may quote (with a slight variation) a sentence of Aristotle, who insisted\nthat \"tragedies and comedies are made up of the same letters.\" The element as such, not its\nchanging implementations, has made our history. That is what my fast-forward account of the\nhistory of European technology had in mind.\n[Footnote]\n1.
