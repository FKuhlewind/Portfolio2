      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>Thinking about from where I started a few months ago I can say that I have come a long way and acquired a lot of very useful skills that can be put into practice in many areas of life.</p> 
      <p>With regards to programming I have learned how important it is to track every step one takes (console.log) and that it is also important to know when to take regular breaks. The libraries and tools I came across opened up very interesting possibilities to enable real-time interaction with various content. Last but not least, learning about <a href="https://www.mashape.com/" target="_blank">Web-APIs</a> in the second half of the course made things really interesting. Great tools are nice, but what's the point of a hammer if you can't find the nails?</p>
      <p>Relating those tools to the humanities, I am starting to understand how and why they can be very useful. Not only is there no reason why scholars of the humanities should exclude themselves from recent technological development. Those tools can be time-saving as well as they enable not only a new quantity but also a knew quality of knowledge. If texts describe images and images supersede texts, why not <a href="http://christophermanning.org/projects/voronoi-diagram-with-force-directed-nodes-and-delaunay-links/" target="_blank">visualize text</a> and let some hybrids enter the textual zoo? </p>
      <p>I personally am most interested in experimental aspects which combine the arts, humanities and technology. I picture an experimental set-up of tools which can be fed with data of all sorts and produces images and new raw data. Hopefully images that allow us to gain new insights and perspectives.</p>
      <p>I conclude this portfolio knowing that many more improvements could have been made regarding this site. But having experienced the addictive spell of coding, this feels like a good point to stop. I would like to thank <a href="http://codingthehumanities.com/people.html#jan-hein-hoogstad" target="_blank">Jan Hein Hoogstad</a> for giving this diversified seminar, including a healthy mix of live-coding (not so healthy for the eye) and interesting discussions on the state of the humanities.</p>
